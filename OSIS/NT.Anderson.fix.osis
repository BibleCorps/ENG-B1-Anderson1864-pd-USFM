<p>
<hi type="small-caps">To all</hi> Lovers of Truth, the Author dedicates his Translation of the New Testament.
</p>
<p>
The Author saw, very early in life, that a translation of the New Testament was necessary. He began his investigations at the age of twenty-one, and has faithfully studied the Original since that time. He has made his translation without reference to any version; that is, he adopted no version as a basis. His work is not a Revision of a version, but a Translation; for he was not disposed to be trammeled by any version, but desired to find the truth of God, as it is contained in the Original. The truth thus found, he has endeavored to express in the English language as now spoken. He has been careful to express the exact sense of the Original, without permitting himself to be confined to an imitation of the letter of the Greek. In revising his work, he re-examined the common version, and wherever that version has expressed the sense of the Original in good English, he has adopted it. In this way he has, as he hopes, embodied all the excellencies of that version, and avoided its errors.
</p>
<p>
The author takes pleasure in acknowledging himself largely indebted, for the English dress of the Translation, to his friend, and brother in Christ, <hi type="small-caps">John Augustus Williams</hi>, of Harrodsburg, Kentucky.
</p>
<p>
The work has been carried on under many adverse circumstances; but, by the good providence of God, it has been completed. May it go forth, under the Divine blessing, to establish and comfort the hearts of those who love the Truth.

</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.1.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.17" osisID="Matt.1.17" n="17" />So all the generations from Abraham till David are fourteen generations: and from David till the removal to Babylon are fourteen generations: and from the removal to Babylon till the Christ are fourteen generations.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.1.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.18" osisID="Matt.1.18" n="18" />But Jesus Christ was begotten thus: After his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they had come together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Matt.1.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.19" osisID="Matt.1.19" n="19" />Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not choosing to make an example of her, intended to put her away privately.
<verse eID="Matt.1.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.20" osisID="Matt.1.20" n="20" />But while he was thinking of these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take home Mary your wife; for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Matt.1.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.21" osisID="Matt.1.21" n="21" />And she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus; for he will save his people from their sins.
<verse eID="Matt.1.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.22" osisID="Matt.1.22" n="22" />Now all this was done, that the word might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
<verse eID="Matt.1.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.23" osisID="Matt.1.23" n="23" />Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and his name shall be called Immanuel, which, when translated, is, God with us.
<verse eID="Matt.1.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.24" osisID="Matt.1.24" n="24" />And Joseph awoke from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him; and he took home his wife,
<verse eID="Matt.1.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.1.25" osisID="Matt.1.25" n="25" />and knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son. And he called his name Jesus.

<chapter sID="Matt.2" osisID="Matt.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.1" osisID="Matt.2.1" n="1" />Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem,
<verse eID="Matt.2.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.2" osisID="Matt.2.2" n="2" />saying: Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to do him homage.
<verse eID="Matt.2.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.3" osisID="Matt.2.3" n="3" />When Herod the king heard <transChange type="added">these things</transChange>, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
<verse eID="Matt.2.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.4" osisID="Matt.2.4" n="4" />And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.
<verse eID="Matt.2.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.5" osisID="Matt.2.5" n="5" />And they said to him: In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written by the prophet:
<verse eID="Matt.2.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.6" osisID="Matt.2.6" n="6" />And thou, Bethlehem, city of Judah, art by no means the least among the chiefs of Judah; for out of thee shall come a leader, that shall be a shepherd to my people Israel.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.2.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.7" osisID="Matt.2.7" n="7" />Then Herod, when he had secretly called the Magi, inquired of them strictly at what time the star, then visible, first made its appearance:
<verse eID="Matt.2.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.8" osisID="Matt.2.8" n="8" />and sending them to Bethlehem, he said: Go, make strict inquiry for the young child: and when you have found him, bring me word, that I also may go and do him homage.
<verse eID="Matt.2.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.9" osisID="Matt.2.9" n="9" />When they had heard the king, they departed; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over the place where the young child was.
<verse eID="Matt.2.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.10" osisID="Matt.2.10" n="10" />And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.
<verse eID="Matt.2.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.11" osisID="Matt.2.11" n="11" />And having come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother; and falling down, they did him homage. And when they had opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
<verse eID="Matt.2.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.12" osisID="Matt.2.12" n="12" />And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country by another way.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.2.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.13" osisID="Matt.2.13" n="13" />When they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying: Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there till I bring you word; for Herod is about to seek for the young child, to destroy him.
<verse eID="Matt.2.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.14" osisID="Matt.2.14" n="14" />And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,
<verse eID="Matt.2.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.15" osisID="Matt.2.15" n="15" />and was there till the death of Herod; that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through his prophet, saying: Out of Egypt have I called my Son.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.2.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.16" osisID="Matt.2.16" n="16" />Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the Magi, was greatly enraged, and sent out and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem and in all its borders, from the age of two years and under, according to the time which he had strictly inquired of the Magi.
<verse eID="Matt.2.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.17" osisID="Matt.2.17" n="17" />Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
<verse eID="Matt.2.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.18" osisID="Matt.2.18" n="18" />A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted because they are no more.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.2.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.19" osisID="Matt.2.19" n="19" />But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
<verse eID="Matt.2.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.20" osisID="Matt.2.20" n="20" />saying: Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought the young child’s life.
<verse eID="Matt.2.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.2.21" osisID="Matt.2.21" n="21" />And he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

<chapter sID="Matt.3" osisID="Matt.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.1" osisID="Matt.3.1" n="1" />In those days came John the Immerser, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
<verse eID="Matt.3.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.2" osisID="Matt.3.2" n="2" />and saying: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
<verse eID="Matt.3.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.3" osisID="Matt.3.3" n="3" />For this is he that was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
<verse eID="Matt.3.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.4" osisID="Matt.3.4" n="4" />But the same John had his clothing of camel’s hair, and a girdle of leather around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.3.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.5" osisID="Matt.3.5" n="5" />Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,
<verse eID="Matt.3.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.6" osisID="Matt.3.6" n="6" />and were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
<verse eID="Matt.3.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.7" osisID="Matt.3.7" n="7" />But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them: Generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coining wrath?
<verse eID="Matt.3.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.8" osisID="Matt.3.8" n="8" />Bring forth, therefore, fruit worthy of repentance:
<verse eID="Matt.3.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.9" osisID="Matt.3.9" n="9" />and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
<verse eID="Matt.3.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.10" osisID="Matt.3.10" n="10" />Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees: therefore, every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
<verse eID="Matt.3.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.11" osisID="Matt.3.11" n="11" />I immerse you in water, in order to repentance; but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and in fire:
<verse eID="Matt.3.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.12" osisID="Matt.3.12" n="12" />whose winnowing-shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his thrashing-floor, and gather his grain into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.3.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.13" osisID="Matt.3.13" n="13" />Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be immersed by him.
<verse eID="Matt.3.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.14" osisID="Matt.3.14" n="14" />But John forbade him, saying: I have need to be immersed by thee, and comest thou to me?
<verse eID="Matt.3.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.15" osisID="Matt.3.15" n="15" />But Jesus answering said to him: Permit it now; for thus it becomes us to perform fully every righteous act. Then he permitted him.
<verse eID="Matt.3.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.16" osisID="Matt.3.16" n="16" />And after Jesus was immersed, he came up immediately from the water; and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon him.
<verse eID="Matt.3.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.3.17" osisID="Matt.3.17" n="17" />And lo, a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight.

<verse eID="Matt.4.1" />

<verse eID="Matt.4.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.4.3" osisID="Matt.4.3" n="3" />And the tempter came to him and said: If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.
<verse eID="Matt.4.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.4.4" osisID="Matt.4.4" n="4" />But he answered and said: It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.
<verse eID="Matt.4.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.4.5" osisID="Matt.4.5" n="5" />Then the devil took him into the holy city, and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple,
<verse eID="Matt.4.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.4.6" osisID="Matt.4.6" n="6" />and said to him: If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: He will give his angels charge concerning you; and in their hands shall they take you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.
<verse eID="Matt.4.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.4.7" osisID="Matt.4.7" n="7" />Jesus said to him: It is again written, You shall not put the Lord your God to the proof.

<verse sID="Matt.6.17" osisID="Matt.6.17" n="17" />But do you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face;
<verse eID="Matt.6.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.18" osisID="Matt.6.18" n="18" />that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

<verse eID="Matt.6.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.19" osisID="Matt.6.19" n="19" />Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal.
<verse eID="Matt.6.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.20" osisID="Matt.6.20" n="20" />But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal.
<verse eID="Matt.6.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.21" osisID="Matt.6.21" n="21" />For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
<verse eID="Matt.6.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.22" osisID="Matt.6.22" n="22" />The lamp of the body is the eye: if, therefore, your eye be sound, your whole body will be light:
<verse eID="Matt.6.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.23" osisID="Matt.6.23" n="23" />But if your eye be diseased, your whole body will be dark. If therefore, the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!

<verse eID="Matt.6.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.24" osisID="Matt.6.24" n="24" />No one can serve two masters: for he will either hate the one and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and neglect the other. You can not serve God and riches.
<verse eID="Matt.6.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.25" osisID="Matt.6.25" n="25" />For this reason I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what you shall eat, and what you shall drink; nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not your life a greater gift than food, and your body than clothing?
<verse eID="Matt.6.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.26" osisID="Matt.6.26" n="26" />Observe the birds of the air, that they neither sow, nor reap, nor gather into granaries. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
<verse eID="Matt.6.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.27" osisID="Matt.6.27" n="27" />Which of you, by his anxiety, can add one span to his life?
<verse eID="Matt.6.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.28" osisID="Matt.6.28" n="28" />And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow: they toil not, nor do they spin.
<verse eID="Matt.6.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.29" osisID="Matt.6.29" n="29" />But I say to you, That Solomon, in all his glory, was not clothed like one of these.
<verse eID="Matt.6.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.30" osisID="Matt.6.30" n="30" />If then, God so clothes the herb of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
<verse eID="Matt.6.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.31" osisID="Matt.6.31" n="31" />Therefore, be not anxious, saying: What shall we eat? or, what shall we drink? or, with what shall we be clothed?
<verse eID="Matt.6.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.32" osisID="Matt.6.32" n="32" />For after all these things do the Gentiles seek: for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
<verse eID="Matt.6.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.33" osisID="Matt.6.33" n="33" />But seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be given to you in addition.
<verse eID="Matt.6.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.6.34" osisID="Matt.6.34" n="34" />Therefore, be not anxious about the morrow, for the morrow will have anxieties of its own. Sufficient for the day is its own evil.

<verse sID="Matt.9.28" osisID="Matt.9.28" n="28" />And when he had entered the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus said to them: Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, Lord.
<verse eID="Matt.9.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.9.29" osisID="Matt.9.29" n="29" />Then he touched their eyes, and said: According to your faith, be it to you.

<verse sID="Matt.10.25" osisID="Matt.10.25" n="25" />It is enough for the disciple, that he be as his teacher; and for the servant, that he be as his master. If they call the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household?
<verse eID="Matt.10.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.10.26" osisID="Matt.10.26" n="26" />Fear them not, therefore; for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, nor hidden that shall not be made known.

<p>
<verse eID="Matt.11.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.11.2" osisID="Matt.11.2" n="2" />Now when John had heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent two of his disciples,

<verse eID="Matt.11.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.11.8" osisID="Matt.11.8" n="8" />But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses.

<verse eID="Matt.12.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.4" osisID="Matt.12.4" n="4" />how he entered the house of God, and ate the loaves of the presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests only?

<verse sID="Matt.12.7" osisID="Matt.12.7" n="7" />But if you had known what this means―I desire mercy, and not sacrifice―you would not have condemned the blameless.

<verse eID="Matt.12.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.11" osisID="Matt.12.11" n="11" />And he said to them: What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the Sabbath-day, will he not lay hold on it and lift it out?
<verse eID="Matt.12.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.12" osisID="Matt.12.12" n="12" />How much better, then, is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath-days.

<verse sID="Matt.12.22" osisID="Matt.12.22" n="22" />Then was brought to him a demoniac, blind and dumb: and he cured him, so that the blind and dumb man both spoke and saw.
<verse eID="Matt.12.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.23" osisID="Matt.12.23" n="23" />And all the people were amazed, and said: Is not this the son of David?
<verse eID="Matt.12.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.24" osisID="Matt.12.24" n="24" />But the Pharisees, when they heard it, said: This man does not cast out the demons, unless by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.
<verse eID="Matt.12.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.25" osisID="Matt.12.25" n="25" />But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And no city or house divided against itself shall stand.
<verse eID="Matt.12.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.26" osisID="Matt.12.26" n="26" />And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?

<verse sID="Matt.12.27" osisID="Matt.12.27" n="27" />And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason, they shall be your judges.
<verse eID="Matt.12.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.28" osisID="Matt.12.28" n="28" />But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has already come upon you.
<verse eID="Matt.12.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.29" osisID="Matt.12.29" n="29" />Or, how can any one enter the house of the strong man and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house.
<verse eID="Matt.12.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.30" osisID="Matt.12.30" n="30" />He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathers not with me, scatters.

<verse eID="Matt.12.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.31" osisID="Matt.12.31" n="31" />Therefore I say to you, That every sin and impious speech shad be forgiven men: but the impious speech against the Spirit shall not be forgiven men.
<verse eID="Matt.12.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.32" osisID="Matt.12.32" n="32" />And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in the present age, or in that which is to come.
<verse eID="Matt.12.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.33" osisID="Matt.12.33" n="33" />Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree unsound, and its fruit unsound. For by the fruit the tree is known.
<verse eID="Matt.12.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.34" osisID="Matt.12.34" n="34" />Generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
<verse eID="Matt.12.34" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.35" osisID="Matt.12.35" n="35" />The good man, out of his good treasury, brings forth good things; and the evil man, out of his evil treasury, brings forth evil things.
<verse eID="Matt.12.35" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.36" osisID="Matt.12.36" n="36" />But I say to you, That for every idle word which men speak, they shall give account in the day of judgment.
<verse eID="Matt.12.36" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.37" osisID="Matt.12.37" n="37" />For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.12.37" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.38" osisID="Matt.12.38" n="38" />Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered and said: Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.
<verse eID="Matt.12.38" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.39" osisID="Matt.12.39" n="39" />But he answered and said to them: A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; and no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
<verse eID="Matt.12.39" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.40" osisID="Matt.12.40" n="40" />For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
<verse eID="Matt.12.40" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.41" osisID="Matt.12.41" n="41" />Tho men of Nineveh shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it; for they repented in accordance with the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
<verse eID="Matt.12.41" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.42" osisID="Matt.12.42" n="42" />The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the most distant parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.12.42" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.43" osisID="Matt.12.43" n="43" />When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places seeking rest, and finds none.
<verse eID="Matt.12.43" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.44" osisID="Matt.12.44" n="44" />Then he says: I will return to my house, out of which I came. And he comes and finds it empty, swept, and set in order.
<verse eID="Matt.12.44" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.45" osisID="Matt.12.45" n="45" />Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in and dwell there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it be with this wicked generation.

<verse eID="Matt.12.47" />
<verse sID="Matt.12.48" osisID="Matt.12.48" n="48" />But he answered and said to him that told him: Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?

<chapter sID="Matt.13" osisID="Matt.13" n="13" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.1" osisID="Matt.13.1" n="1" />On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the sea.
<verse eID="Matt.13.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.2" osisID="Matt.13.2" n="2" />And many multitudes came together to him, so that he went into a ship and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.3" osisID="Matt.13.3" n="3" />And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying: Behold, the sower went out to sow.
<verse eID="Matt.13.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.4" osisID="Matt.13.4" n="4" />And as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way: and the birds came and ate them up.
<verse eID="Matt.13.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.5" osisID="Matt.13.5" n="5" />Others fell on stony places, where they had not much earth; and they immediately sprung up, because they had no depth of earth.
<verse eID="Matt.13.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.6" osisID="Matt.13.6" n="6" />But when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
<verse eID="Matt.13.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.7" osisID="Matt.13.7" n="7" />Others fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up and choked them.
<verse eID="Matt.13.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.8" osisID="Matt.13.8" n="8" />Others fell upon good ground, and brought forth fruit, some a hundred, some fifty, some thirty.
<verse eID="Matt.13.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.9" osisID="Matt.13.9" n="9" />He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.10" osisID="Matt.13.10" n="10" />And the disciples came and said to him: Why dost thou speak to them in parables?
<verse eID="Matt.13.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.11" osisID="Matt.13.11" n="11" />He answered, and said to them: Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it is not given.
<verse eID="Matt.13.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.12" osisID="Matt.13.12" n="12" />For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever has not, even that which he has shall be taken from him.
<verse eID="Matt.13.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.13" osisID="Matt.13.13" n="13" />For this reason I speak to them in parables; because when they see, they see not; and when they hear, they hear not, nor do they understand.
<verse eID="Matt.13.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.14" osisID="Matt.13.14" n="14" />And in them is fulfilled the prophesy of Isaiah, which says: You shall surely hear, and you will not understand; and you shall surely see, and you will not perceive.
<verse eID="Matt.13.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.15" osisID="Matt.13.15" n="15" />For the heart of this people has become fat; and with their ears they hear heavily; and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should turn to me, and I should give them health.
<verse eID="Matt.13.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.16" osisID="Matt.13.16" n="16" />But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
<verse eID="Matt.13.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.17" osisID="Matt.13.17" n="17" />For verily I say to you, Many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.18" osisID="Matt.13.18" n="18" />Hear you, therefore, the parable of the sower.
<verse eID="Matt.13.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.19" osisID="Matt.13.19" n="19" />When any one hears the word of the kingdom, and understands it not, the wicked one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he that received seed by the wayside.
<verse eID="Matt.13.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.20" osisID="Matt.13.20" n="20" />He that received seed on the stony places is he that hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy.
<verse eID="Matt.13.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.21" osisID="Matt.13.21" n="21" />Yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while; and when affliction or persecution arises on account of the word, he immediately takes offense.
<verse eID="Matt.13.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.22" osisID="Matt.13.22" n="22" />He that received seed among the thorns, is he that hears the word; and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
<verse eID="Matt.13.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.23" osisID="Matt.13.23" n="23" />But he that received seed on the good ground, is he that hears the word and understands it; who also produces fruit, and yields, one a hundred; another, sixty; another, thirty.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.24" osisID="Matt.13.24" n="24" />Another parable he laid before them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his field.
<verse eID="Matt.13.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.25" osisID="Matt.13.25" n="25" />But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.
<verse eID="Matt.13.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.26" osisID="Matt.13.26" n="26" />But when the blade sprung up, and produced fruit, then appeared the tares also.
<verse eID="Matt.13.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.27" osisID="Matt.13.27" n="27" />And the servants of the master of the house came, and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Whence, then, has it tares?
<verse eID="Matt.13.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.28" osisID="Matt.13.28" n="28" />He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Is it your will, then, that we go and gather them up?
<verse eID="Matt.13.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.29" osisID="Matt.13.29" n="29" />But he said, No; lest while you are gathering the tares, you root up the wheat with them.
<verse eID="Matt.13.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.30" osisID="Matt.13.30" n="30" />Let both grow together till the harvest, and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares, and bind them into bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my granary.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.31" osisID="Matt.13.31" n="31" />Another parable he laid before them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard, that a man took and sowed in his field.
<verse eID="Matt.13.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.32" osisID="Matt.13.32" n="32" />It is, indeed, the least of all seeds; but when it is grown it is the largest of garden-plants, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and roost in its branches.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.33" osisID="Matt.13.33" n="33" />He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till the whole was leavened.
<verse eID="Matt.13.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.34" osisID="Matt.13.34" n="34" />All these things Jesus spoke to the multitudes in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them;
<verse eID="Matt.13.34" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.35" osisID="Matt.13.35" n="35" />that the word might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things that have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.35" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.36" osisID="Matt.13.36" n="36" />Then Jesus left the multitudes, and went into the house. And his disciples came to him and said: Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.
<verse eID="Matt.13.36" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.37" osisID="Matt.13.37" n="37" />He answered and said to them: He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;
<verse eID="Matt.13.37" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.38" osisID="Matt.13.38" n="38" />the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; the tares are the sons of the Wicked One;
<verse eID="Matt.13.38" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.39" osisID="Matt.13.39" n="39" />the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels.
<verse eID="Matt.13.39" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.40" osisID="Matt.13.40" n="40" />As, therefore, the tares are collected and burned in fire, so shall it be in the end of this age.
<verse eID="Matt.13.40" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.41" osisID="Matt.13.41" n="41" />The Son of man will send forth his angels, and collect out of his kingdom all things that offend, and those who work iniquity,
<verse eID="Matt.13.41" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.42" osisID="Matt.13.42" n="42" />and cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
<verse eID="Matt.13.42" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.43" osisID="Matt.13.43" n="43" />Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.43" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.44" osisID="Matt.13.44" n="44" />Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hid in a field, which, when a man finds it, he hides; and for the joy it gives, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.44" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.45" osisID="Matt.13.45" n="45" />Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls.
<verse eID="Matt.13.45" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.46" osisID="Matt.13.46" n="46" />When he finds one pearl of great value, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys it.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.46" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.47" osisID="Matt.13.47" n="47" />Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that is cast into the sea, and that gathers of every kind:
<verse eID="Matt.13.47" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.48" osisID="Matt.13.48" n="48" />when it is full, they draw it to the shore; and sitting down, they collect the good into vessels, but throw the bad away.
<verse eID="Matt.13.48" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.49" osisID="Matt.13.49" n="49" />So shall it be in the end of the age: the angels shall come forth and separate the wicked from among the just,
<verse eID="Matt.13.49" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.50" osisID="Matt.13.50" n="50" />and cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.50" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.51" osisID="Matt.13.51" n="51" />Jesus said to them: Have you understood all these things? They said to him: Yes, Lord.
<verse eID="Matt.13.51" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.52" osisID="Matt.13.52" n="52" />He said to them: Therefore, every scribe that is trained for the kingdom of heaven, is like the master of a house, who brings out of his treasury things new and old.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.13.52" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.53" osisID="Matt.13.53" n="53" />And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from that place.
<verse eID="Matt.13.53" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.54" osisID="Matt.13.54" n="54" />And he came into his own country, and taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said: Whence has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?
<verse eID="Matt.13.54" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.55" osisID="Matt.13.55" n="55" />Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James and Joses and Simon and Judas?
<verse eID="Matt.13.55" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.56" osisID="Matt.13.56" n="56" />And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence, then, has this man all these things?
<verse eID="Matt.13.56" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.57" osisID="Matt.13.57" n="57" />And they found in him occasion for offense. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, unless it be in his own country and in his own house.
<verse eID="Matt.13.57" />
<verse sID="Matt.13.58" osisID="Matt.13.58" n="58" />And he did not many mighty works there, on account of their unbelief.

<p>

<verse sID="Matt.14.6" osisID="Matt.14.6" n="6" />But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
<verse eID="Matt.14.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.7" osisID="Matt.14.7" n="7" />Wherefore he promised, with an oath, to give her whatever she would ask.
<verse eID="Matt.14.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.8" osisID="Matt.14.8" n="8" />And being previously instigated by her mother, she said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Immerser?

<verse sID="Matt.14.9" osisID="Matt.14.9" n="9" />And the king was grieved: but on account of his oath, and those who reclined at table with him, he commanded it to be given.
<verse eID="Matt.14.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.10" osisID="Matt.14.10" n="10" />And he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
<verse eID="Matt.14.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.11" osisID="Matt.14.11" n="11" />And his head was brought in a dish, and given to the maiden: and she carried it to her mother.
<verse eID="Matt.14.11" />

</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.14.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.13" osisID="Matt.14.13" n="13" />And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew from that place, by ship, into a desert place apart: and the multitudes, when they heard of <transChange type="added">his departure</transChange>, followed him, on foot, from the cities.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.14.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.14" osisID="Matt.14.14" n="14" />And when Jesus came out, he saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion for them, and cured their sick.

<verse eID="Matt.14.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.16" osisID="Matt.14.16" n="16" />But Jesus said to them: They need not go away; do you give them food.
<verse eID="Matt.14.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.17" osisID="Matt.14.17" n="17" />They said to him: We have here but five loaves and two fishes.

<verse sID="Matt.14.28" osisID="Matt.14.28" n="28" />And Peter answered him, and said: Lord, if it be thou, bid me come to thee on the water.

<verse sID="Matt.14.29" osisID="Matt.14.29" n="29" />And he said: Come. And Peter went down from the ship, and walked upon the water to go to Jesus.
<verse eID="Matt.14.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.30" osisID="Matt.14.30" n="30" />But when he saw the wind strong, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me.
<verse eID="Matt.14.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.14.31" osisID="Matt.14.31" n="31" />And Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and said to him: O you of little faith, why did you doubt?

<verse eID="Matt.15.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.2" osisID="Matt.15.2" n="2" />Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
<verse eID="Matt.15.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.3" osisID="Matt.15.3" n="3" />But he answered and said to them: And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?
<verse eID="Matt.15.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.4" osisID="Matt.15.4" n="4" />For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and your mother; and, He that curses father or mother shall surely be put to death.
<verse eID="Matt.15.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.5" osisID="Matt.15.5" n="5" />But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, Whatever of mine might profit you, is a gift, he must in no way honor his father or his mother;
<verse eID="Matt.15.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.6" osisID="Matt.15.6" n="6" />and you make the commandment of God of no effect for the sake of your tradition.
<verse eID="Matt.15.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.7" osisID="Matt.15.7" n="7" />Hypocrites! well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
<verse eID="Matt.15.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.8" osisID="Matt.15.8" n="8" />This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
<verse eID="Matt.15.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.9" osisID="Matt.15.9" n="9" />But in vain, do they worship me, teaching precepts, the commandments of men.

<p>

<verse eID="Matt.15.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.11" osisID="Matt.15.11" n="11" />That which enters the mouth does not defile the man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles the man.

<p>

<verse sID="Matt.15.12" osisID="Matt.15.12" n="12" />Then came his disciples and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard that saying, were offended?
<verse eID="Matt.15.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.13" osisID="Matt.15.13" n="13" />But he answered and said: Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.

<verse sID="Matt.15.14" osisID="Matt.15.14" n="14" />Let them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit.

<verse sID="Matt.15.18" osisID="Matt.15.18" n="18" />But those things which go out from the mouth, come from the heart; and these defile the man.
<verse eID="Matt.15.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.19" osisID="Matt.15.19" n="19" />For from the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, lewd actions, thefts, false testimonies, impious words.
<verse eID="Matt.15.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.20" osisID="Matt.15.20" n="20" />These are the things that defile the man. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.

<verse sID="Matt.15.22" osisID="Matt.15.22" n="22" />And behold, a woman of Chanaan came out from those borders, and cried to him, saying: Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.
<verse eID="Matt.15.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.23" osisID="Matt.15.23" n="23" />But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she cries after us.

<verse sID="Matt.15.24" osisID="Matt.15.24" n="24" />But he answered and said: I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
<verse eID="Matt.15.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.25" osisID="Matt.15.25" n="25" />But she came and did him homage, saying: Lord, help me.

<verse sID="Matt.15.26" osisID="Matt.15.26" n="26" />He answered and said: It is not good to take the children’s bread, and throw it to the little dogs.
<verse eID="Matt.15.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.15.27" osisID="Matt.15.27" n="27" />She replied: Yes, Lord; and yet <transChange type="added">thou canst help me;</transChange> for the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.

<verse sID="Matt.15.30" osisID="Matt.15.30" n="30" />And many multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, the blind, the deaf, the maimed, and many others; and laid them at the feet of Jesus, and he cured them;

<verse sID="Matt.16.7" osisID="Matt.16.7" n="7" />And they reasoned among themselves, saying: It is because we took no bread.

<verse sID="Matt.17.17" osisID="Matt.17.17" n="17" />Jesus answered and said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to me.
<verse eID="Matt.17.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.18" osisID="Matt.17.18" n="18" />And Jesus rebuked the demon, and he came out of him: and the child was cured from that hour.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.17.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.19" osisID="Matt.17.19" n="19" />Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said: Why were we not able to cast him out?
<verse eID="Matt.17.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.20" osisID="Matt.17.20" n="20" />And Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For verily I say to you, If you have faith like a grain of mustard-seed, you shall say to this mountain, Be removed from this place to that, and it shall be removed: and nothing shall be impossible for you.
<verse eID="Matt.17.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.21" osisID="Matt.17.21" n="21" />But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.17.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.22" osisID="Matt.17.22" n="22" />And as they were making their journey in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men;
<verse eID="Matt.17.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.23" osisID="Matt.17.23" n="23" />and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised again. And they were very sad.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.17.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.24" osisID="Matt.17.24" n="24" />And when they had come into Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma came to Peter, and said: Does not your teacher pay the didrachma?
<verse eID="Matt.17.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.25" osisID="Matt.17.25" n="25" />He said: Yes. And when he had come into the house, before he had spoken, Jesus said to him: What think you, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tax or tribute? From their own sons, or from the sons of others?
<verse eID="Matt.17.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.26" osisID="Matt.17.26" n="26" />Peter said to him: From the sons of others. Jesus said to him: Then are their own sons free.
<verse eID="Matt.17.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.17.27" osisID="Matt.17.27" n="27" />But that we may give them no offense, go to the sea, and throw in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first; and when you have opened his mouth, you will find a stater; take that, and give to them for me and you.

<chapter sID="Matt.18" osisID="Matt.18" n="18" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.1" osisID="Matt.18.1" n="1" />At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, and said: Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
<verse eID="Matt.18.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.2" osisID="Matt.18.2" n="2" />And Jesus called a little child to him, and placed him in the midst of them,
<verse eID="Matt.18.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.3" osisID="Matt.18.3" n="3" />and said: Verily I say to you, Unless you turn and become as little children, you can not enter the kingdom of heaven.
<verse eID="Matt.18.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.4" osisID="Matt.18.4" n="4" />Whoever, therefore, humbles himself as this little child, is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
<verse eID="Matt.18.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.5" osisID="Matt.18.5" n="5" />And whoever receives one such little child on my account, receives me;
<verse eID="Matt.18.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.6" osisID="Matt.18.6" n="6" />but whoever ensnares one of these little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.18.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.7" osisID="Matt.18.7" n="7" />Alas for the world because of snares! for it is necessary that snares come: but alas for that man by whom the snare comes!
<verse eID="Matt.18.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.8" osisID="Matt.18.8" n="8" />If, then, your hand or your foot ensnares you, cut it off, and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire.
<verse eID="Matt.18.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.9" osisID="Matt.18.9" n="9" />And if your eye ensnares you, pull it out, and throw it from you. It is better to enter into life with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be thrown into hell-fire.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.18.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.10" osisID="Matt.18.10" n="10" />Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say to you, That their angels in heaven do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
<verse eID="Matt.18.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.11" osisID="Matt.18.11" n="11" />For the Son of man has come to save that which is lost.
<verse eID="Matt.18.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.12" osisID="Matt.18.12" n="12" />What think you? If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them go astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine, and go into the mountains, and seek for that which has gone astray?
<verse eID="Matt.18.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.13" osisID="Matt.18.13" n="13" />And if it so be that he find it, verily I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
<verse eID="Matt.18.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.14" osisID="Matt.18.14" n="14" />Even so, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should be lost.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.18.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.15" osisID="Matt.18.15" n="15" />And if your brother sin against you, go and tell him of his fault between you and him alone; if he hear you, you have gained your brother.
<verse eID="Matt.18.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.16" osisID="Matt.18.16" n="16" />But if he will not hear you, take with you one or two more, that, by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established.
<verse eID="Matt.18.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.17" osisID="Matt.18.17" n="17" />But if he refuse to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he also refuse to hear the church, let him be to you as a heathen man and a publican.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.18.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.18" osisID="Matt.18.18" n="18" />Verily, I say to you, <transChange type="added">my disciples,</transChange> Whatever you bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.
<verse eID="Matt.18.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.19" osisID="Matt.18.19" n="19" />Again, I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about any thing for which they will ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
<verse eID="Matt.18.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.20" osisID="Matt.18.20" n="20" />For where there are two or three that have come together for my sake, there I am in the midst of them.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.18.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.21" osisID="Matt.18.21" n="21" />Then Peter came to him, and said: Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till seven times?
<verse eID="Matt.18.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.22" osisID="Matt.18.22" n="22" />Jesus said to him: I say to you, Not till seven times, but till seventy times seven.
<verse eID="Matt.18.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.23" osisID="Matt.18.23" n="23" />For this reason, the kingdom of heaven is likened to a king that wished to settle accounts with his servants.
<verse eID="Matt.18.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.24" osisID="Matt.18.24" n="24" />And when he began to make a settlement, there was brought to him one that owed him ten thou sand talents.
<verse eID="Matt.18.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.25" osisID="Matt.18.25" n="25" />But as he was not able to pay, his lord commanded him, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, to be sold, and payment to be made.
<verse eID="Matt.18.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.26" osisID="Matt.18.26" n="26" />Therefore, the servant fell down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, Lord, and I will pay you all.
<verse eID="Matt.18.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.27" osisID="Matt.18.27" n="27" />And the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and let him go, and forgave him the debt.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.18.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.28" osisID="Matt.18.28" n="28" />But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hold of him, and took him by the throat, saying: Pay me what you owe.
<verse eID="Matt.18.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.29" osisID="Matt.18.29" n="29" />Then his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.
<verse eID="Matt.18.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.30" osisID="Matt.18.30" n="30" />And he would not; but went and threw him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
<verse eID="Matt.18.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.31" osisID="Matt.18.31" n="31" />When his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very sad, and went and made known to their lord all that was done.
<verse eID="Matt.18.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.32" osisID="Matt.18.32" n="32" />Then his lord called him and said to him: Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you besought me.
<verse eID="Matt.18.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.33" osisID="Matt.18.33" n="33" />Ought you not to have had mercy on your fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on you?
<verse eID="Matt.18.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.34" osisID="Matt.18.34" n="34" />And his lord was angry, and delivered him to the jailers, till he should pay all that was due him.
<verse eID="Matt.18.34" />
<verse sID="Matt.18.35" osisID="Matt.18.35" n="35" />So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if, from your hearts, you forgive not every one his brother’s offenses.

<chapter sID="Matt.19" osisID="Matt.19" n="19" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.1" osisID="Matt.19.1" n="1" />And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these discourses, that he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan.
<verse eID="Matt.19.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.2" osisID="Matt.19.2" n="2" />And many multitudes followed him; and he cured them there.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.19.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.3" osisID="Matt.19.3" n="3" />And the Pharisees came to him to tempt him, and said to him: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
<verse eID="Matt.19.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.4" osisID="Matt.19.4" n="4" />He answered and said to them: Have you not read that the Creator, at the beginning, created them male and female,
<verse eID="Matt.19.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.5" osisID="Matt.19.5" n="5" />and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh?
<verse eID="Matt.19.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.6" osisID="Matt.19.6" n="6" />So then, they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man put asunder.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.19.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.7" osisID="Matt.19.7" n="7" />They said to him: Why, then, did Moses command us to give a bill of divorce and put her away?
<verse eID="Matt.19.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.8" osisID="Matt.19.8" n="8" />He said to them: Moses, on account of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.
<verse eID="Matt.19.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.9" osisID="Matt.19.9" n="9" />But I say to you, That whoever puts away his wife, unless for lewdness, and marries another, commits adultery; and he that marries her that is put away, commits adultery.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.19.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.10" osisID="Matt.19.10" n="10" />His disciples said to him: If the relation of man and wife be such, it is not good to marry.
<verse eID="Matt.19.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.11" osisID="Matt.19.11" n="11" />But he said to them: All can not accept this saying; only those to whom it is given.
<verse eID="Matt.19.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.12" osisID="Matt.19.12" n="12" />For there are eunuchs that were born such from their mother’s womb; and there are eunuchs that have been made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs that have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him accept it that is able to accept it.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.19.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.13" osisID="Matt.19.13" n="13" />Then little children were brought to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray. And the disciples rebuked them.
<verse eID="Matt.19.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.14" osisID="Matt.19.14" n="14" />But Jesus said: Let the little children come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
<verse eID="Matt.19.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.15" osisID="Matt.19.15" n="15" />And he laid his hands on them, and departed from that place.

<p>
<verse eID="Matt.19.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.16" osisID="Matt.19.16" n="16" />And behold, one came and said to him: Good teacher, what good thing must I do that I may have eternal life? He said to him:
<verse eID="Matt.19.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.17" osisID="Matt.19.17" n="17" />Why do you call me good? There is none good but one, that is God. But if you desire to enter into life, keep the commandments.
<verse eID="Matt.19.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.18" osisID="Matt.19.18" n="18" />He said to him: Which? Jesus replied: You shall not kill; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not give false testimony;

<verse sID="Matt.19.19" osisID="Matt.19.19" n="19" />Honor your father and your mother; and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
<verse eID="Matt.19.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.20" osisID="Matt.19.20" n="20" />The young man said to him: All these have I kept from my youth, what do I lack?
<verse eID="Matt.19.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.21" osisID="Matt.19.21" n="21" />Jesus said to him: If you would be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
<verse eID="Matt.19.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.22" osisID="Matt.19.22" n="22" />When the young man heard that saying, he went away grieved; for he had great possessions.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.19.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.23" osisID="Matt.19.23" n="23" />Jesus said to his disciples: Verily I say to you, A rich man will with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven.
<verse eID="Matt.19.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.24" osisID="Matt.19.24" n="24" />And again I say to you: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
<verse eID="Matt.19.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.25" osisID="Matt.19.25" n="25" />When the disciples heard it, they were greatly amazed, and said: Who, then, can be saved?
<verse eID="Matt.19.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.26" osisID="Matt.19.26" n="26" />But Jesus looked on them, and said to them: With men, this is impossible; but with God, all things are possible.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.19.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.27" osisID="Matt.19.27" n="27" />Then Peter answered and said to him: Behold, we have left all and followed thee; what, then, shall we have?
<verse eID="Matt.19.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.28" osisID="Matt.19.28" n="28" />Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you, That, in the restoration, when the Son of man shall sit on his glorious throne, you also who have followed me shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
<verse eID="Matt.19.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.19.29" osisID="Matt.19.29" n="29" />And every one that has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.

<verse eID="Matt.20.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.20.2" osisID="Matt.20.2" n="2" />And when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

<p>
<verse eID="Matt.20.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.20.8" osisID="Matt.20.8" n="8" />When the evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward: Call the laborers, and, beginning with the last, pay them their hire even to the first.

<verse eID="Matt.20.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.20.11" osisID="Matt.20.11" n="11" />And when they received it, they murmured against the master of the house,

<verse sID="Matt.20.26" osisID="Matt.20.26" n="26" />It shall not be so among you. But whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister.

<verse sID="Matt.20.27" osisID="Matt.20.27" n="27" />And whoever will be first among you, let him be your servant;

<verse sID="Matt.20.28" osisID="Matt.20.28" n="28" />even as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

<verse eID="Matt.20.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.20.31" osisID="Matt.20.31" n="31" />And the multitude charged them to be silent. But they cried the more, saying: Have mercy on us, Lord, son of David.

<verse eID="Matt.21.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.2" osisID="Matt.21.2" n="2" />saying to them: Go into the village opposite to you, and immediately you will find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me.

<verse sID="Matt.21.3" osisID="Matt.21.3" n="3" />And if any one say any thing to you, you shall reply: The Lord has need of them: and he will immediately send them.

<verse eID="Matt.21.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.7" osisID="Matt.21.7" n="7" />and brought the ass and the colt, and put their mantles on them, and caused him to sit upon them.
<verse eID="Matt.21.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.8" osisID="Matt.21.8" n="8" />And a very great multitude spread their mantles in the road: and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the road.
<verse eID="Matt.21.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.9" osisID="Matt.21.9" n="9" />And the multitudes that went before, and that followed after, cried, saying: Hosanna to the son of David. Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.

<verse sID="Matt.21.16" osisID="Matt.21.16" n="16" />and they said to him: Do you not hear what these say? And Jesus said to them: Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
<verse eID="Matt.21.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.17" osisID="Matt.21.17" n="17" />And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and there spent the night.

<verse eID="Matt.21.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.20" osisID="Matt.21.20" n="20" />And when the disciples saw it, they were astonished, and said: How soon has the fig-tree withered!
<verse eID="Matt.21.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.21" osisID="Matt.21.21" n="21" />Jesus answered and said to them: Verily I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall do, not only what is done to the fig-tree, but even if you shall say to this mountain, Be taken up, and be thrown into the sea, it shall be done.
<verse eID="Matt.21.21" />

<verse eID="Matt.21.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.24" osisID="Matt.21.24" n="24" />Jesus answered and said to them: I also will ask you one thing, which if you will tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.

<verse sID="Matt.21.27" osisID="Matt.21.27" n="27" />And they answered and said to Jesus: We know not. And he said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

<verse sID="Matt.21.28" osisID="Matt.21.28" n="28" />But what think you? A man had two sons; and he went to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in my vineyard.
<verse eID="Matt.21.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.29" osisID="Matt.21.29" n="29" />He answered and said, I will not. But he afterward regretted it, and went.
<verse eID="Matt.21.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.30" osisID="Matt.21.30" n="30" />And he came to the other, and spoke to him in like manner. And he answered and said, I go, sir; and went not.
<verse eID="Matt.21.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.31" osisID="Matt.21.31" n="31" />Which of the two did the will of his father? They said to him, The first. Jesus said to them: Verily I say to you, The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
<verse eID="Matt.21.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.32" osisID="Matt.21.32" n="32" />For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not. But the publicans and the harlots believed him. And you, when you had seen it, afterward felt no regret, that you might believe him.

<verse sID="Matt.21.33" osisID="Matt.21.33" n="33" />Hear another parable: There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around it, and rigged in it a wine-press, and built a tower, and let it out to vine-dressers, and went into another country.
<verse eID="Matt.21.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.34" osisID="Matt.21.34" n="34" />And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vine-dressers to receive the fruits of it.
<verse eID="Matt.21.34" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.35" osisID="Matt.21.35" n="35" />And the vine-dressers took his servants, and scourged one, and killed another, and stoned another.
<verse eID="Matt.21.35" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.36" osisID="Matt.21.36" n="36" />Again he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them in like manner.
<verse eID="Matt.21.36" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.37" osisID="Matt.21.37" n="37" />But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
<verse eID="Matt.21.37" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.38" osisID="Matt.21.38" n="38" />But the vine-dressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and seize upon the inheritance.
<verse eID="Matt.21.38" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.39" osisID="Matt.21.39" n="39" />And they took him, and carried him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
<verse eID="Matt.21.39" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.40" osisID="Matt.21.40" n="40" />Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.21.40" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.41" osisID="Matt.21.41" n="41" />They said to him: He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and let out his vineyard to other vine-dressers, who will give him the fruits in their season.
<verse eID="Matt.21.41" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.42" osisID="Matt.21.42" n="42" />Jesus said to them: Did you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?
<verse eID="Matt.21.42" />
<verse sID="Matt.21.43" osisID="Matt.21.43" n="43" />This was from the Lord, and it is wondrous in our eyes. For this reason, I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation that will bring forth the fruits of it.

<verse sID="Matt.22.2" osisID="Matt.22.2" n="2" />The kingdom of heaven is like a king that made a marriage feast for his son;

<verse eID="Matt.22.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.4" osisID="Matt.22.4" n="4" />Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.
<verse eID="Matt.22.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.5" osisID="Matt.22.5" n="5" />But they were careless, and went away, one to his farm, another to his merchandise.

<verse sID="Matt.22.6" osisID="Matt.22.6" n="6" />And the rest laid hold of his servants, and abused them, and killed them.

<verse eID="Matt.22.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.8" osisID="Matt.22.8" n="8" />Then he said to his servants: The marriage feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
<verse eID="Matt.22.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.9" osisID="Matt.22.9" n="9" />Go, therefore, to the cross-ways, and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.
<verse eID="Matt.22.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.10" osisID="Matt.22.10" n="10" />And those servants went out into the roads, and brought together all, as many as they found, both bad and good: and the banquet-room was filled with guests.
<verse eID="Matt.22.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.11" osisID="Matt.22.11" n="11" />And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man that had not put on a wedding-robe.
<verse eID="Matt.22.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.12" osisID="Matt.22.12" n="12" />And he said to him, Friend, how came you in hither without a wedding-robe? And he was silent.
<verse eID="Matt.22.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.13" osisID="Matt.22.13" n="13" />Then the king said to his servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and throw him into the darkness without: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
<verse eID="Matt.22.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.14" osisID="Matt.22.14" n="14" />For many are called, but few chosen.

<verse eID="Matt.22.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.16" osisID="Matt.22.16" n="16" />And they sent to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying: Teacher, we know that you are true, and that you teach the way of God in truth, and care not for any one: for you do not look upon the person of men.
<verse eID="Matt.22.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.17" osisID="Matt.22.17" n="17" />Tell us, therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?

<verse sID="Matt.22.18" osisID="Matt.22.18" n="18" />But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said to them: Why do you tempt me, hypocrites?
<verse eID="Matt.22.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.19" osisID="Matt.22.19" n="19" />Show me the tribute-money. And they brought him a denarius.

<verse sID="Matt.22.21" osisID="Matt.22.21" n="21" />They said to him: Cæsar’s. Then he said to them: Give, therefore, to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar s, and to God the things that are God s.
<verse eID="Matt.22.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.22" osisID="Matt.22.22" n="22" />And when they heard it, they were astonished, and left him, and went away.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.22.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.23" osisID="Matt.22.23" n="23" />On that day there came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection; and they put a question to him,
<verse eID="Matt.22.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.24" osisID="Matt.22.24" n="24" />saying: Teacher, Moses commanded, If any one die without children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up children for his brother.
<verse eID="Matt.22.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.25" osisID="Matt.22.25" n="25" />Now there were with us seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died; and, having no child, left his wife to his brother.
<verse eID="Matt.22.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.26" osisID="Matt.22.26" n="26" />In like manner also the second, and the third, to the seventh.
<verse eID="Matt.22.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.27" osisID="Matt.22.27" n="27" />Last of all, the woman also died.
<verse eID="Matt.22.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.28" osisID="Matt.22.28" n="28" />Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of the seven will she be the wife? for they all had her.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.22.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.29" osisID="Matt.22.29" n="29" />Jesus answered and said to them: You err, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.
<verse eID="Matt.22.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.30" osisID="Matt.22.30" n="30" />For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
<verse eID="Matt.22.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.31" osisID="Matt.22.31" n="31" />But, concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying:

<verse sID="Matt.22.32" osisID="Matt.22.32" n="32" />I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

<verse sID="Matt.22.35" osisID="Matt.22.35" n="35" />And one of them, who was a lawyer, asked him a question, that he might tempt him, saying:
<verse eID="Matt.22.35" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.36" osisID="Matt.22.36" n="36" />Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?
<verse eID="Matt.22.36" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.37" osisID="Matt.22.37" n="37" />Jesus said to him: You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind.
<verse eID="Matt.22.37" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.38" osisID="Matt.22.38" n="38" />This is the first and great commandment.
<verse eID="Matt.22.38" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.39" osisID="Matt.22.39" n="39" />And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
<verse eID="Matt.22.39" />

<verse eID="Matt.22.42" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.43" osisID="Matt.22.43" n="43" />He said to them: How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
<verse eID="Matt.22.43" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.44" osisID="Matt.22.44" n="44" />The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
<verse eID="Matt.22.44" />
<verse sID="Matt.22.45" osisID="Matt.22.45" n="45" />If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?

<verse eID="Matt.23.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.23.23" osisID="Matt.23.23" n="23" />Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithes of mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, its justice, its mercy, and its faithfulness.

<verse eID="Matt.23.23" />

<verse eID="Matt.24.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.24.7" osisID="Matt.24.7" n="7" />For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in various places.

<verse sID="Matt.25.21" osisID="Matt.25.21" n="21" />His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many. Enter into the joy of your lord.

<p>
<verse eID="Matt.25.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.22" osisID="Matt.25.22" n="22" />And he also that had received the two talents came, and said: Lord, you delivered to me two talents; see, I have gained other two talents in addition to them.
<verse eID="Matt.25.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.23" osisID="Matt.25.23" n="23" />His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many. Enter into the joy of your lord.

<p>
<verse eID="Matt.25.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.24" osisID="Matt.25.24" n="24" />But he that had received the one talent came, and said: Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
<verse eID="Matt.25.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.25" osisID="Matt.25.25" n="25" />And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth; see, you have yours.
<verse eID="Matt.25.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.26" osisID="Matt.25.26" n="26" />His lord answered and said to him: Wicked and slothful servant; did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter?
<verse eID="Matt.25.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.27" osisID="Matt.25.27" n="27" />Therefore, you ought to have put my money with the bankers; and, when I came, I could have received my own with interest.
<verse eID="Matt.25.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.28" osisID="Matt.25.28" n="28" />Therefore, take from him the talent, and give it to him that has the ten talents.
<verse eID="Matt.25.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.29" osisID="Matt.25.29" n="29" />For to every one that has, it shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken away.
<verse eID="Matt.25.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.30" osisID="Matt.25.30" n="30" />And cast the unprofitable servant into the darkness without. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.25.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.31" osisID="Matt.25.31" n="31" />When the Son of man shall come in his own glory, and all the holy angels with him, then will he sit on the throne of his own glory;
<verse eID="Matt.25.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.32" osisID="Matt.25.32" n="32" />and all nations shall be gathered before him; and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats.
<verse eID="Matt.25.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.33" osisID="Matt.25.33" n="33" />And he will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
<verse eID="Matt.25.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.34" osisID="Matt.25.34" n="34" />Then the King will say to those on his right hand: Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
<verse eID="Matt.25.34" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.35" osisID="Matt.25.35" n="35" />For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me to your houses;

<verse sID="Matt.25.36" osisID="Matt.25.36" n="36" />naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.
<verse eID="Matt.25.36" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.37" osisID="Matt.25.37" n="37" />Then will the righteous answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and feed thee? or thirsty, and give thee drink?
<verse eID="Matt.25.37" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.38" osisID="Matt.25.38" n="38" />When did we see thee a stranger, and take thee to our home? or naked, and clothe thee?

<verse sID="Matt.25.39" osisID="Matt.25.39" n="39" />When did we see thee sick, or in prison, and come to thee?
<verse eID="Matt.25.39" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.40" osisID="Matt.25.40" n="40" />And the King will answer and say to them: Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.25.40" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.41" osisID="Matt.25.41" n="41" />Then will he say to those on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.
<verse eID="Matt.25.41" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.42" osisID="Matt.25.42" n="42" />For I was hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
<verse eID="Matt.25.42" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.43" osisID="Matt.25.43" n="43" />I was a stranger, and you took me not to your houses; naked, and you did not clothe me; I was sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.
<verse eID="Matt.25.43" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.44" osisID="Matt.25.44" n="44" />Then they also will answer, and say: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?
<verse eID="Matt.25.44" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.45" osisID="Matt.25.45" n="45" />Then will he answer them, saying: Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.
<verse eID="Matt.25.45" />
<verse sID="Matt.25.46" osisID="Matt.25.46" n="46" />And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.

<chapter sID="Matt.26" osisID="Matt.26" n="26" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.1" osisID="Matt.26.1" n="1" />And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples:
<verse eID="Matt.26.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.2" osisID="Matt.26.2" n="2" />You know that after two days the passover is kept, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.3" osisID="Matt.26.3" n="3" />Then the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people met together at the palace of the chief priest, who was called Caiaphas.
<verse eID="Matt.26.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.4" osisID="Matt.26.4" n="4" />And they consulted together that they might take Jesus by craft and kill him.
<verse eID="Matt.26.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.5" osisID="Matt.26.5" n="5" />But they said: Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult among the people.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.6" osisID="Matt.26.6" n="6" />When Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
<verse eID="Matt.26.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.7" osisID="Matt.26.7" n="7" />there came to him a woman who had an alabaster box of very costly ointment; and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table.
<verse eID="Matt.26.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.8" osisID="Matt.26.8" n="8" />But when his disciples saw it, they were displeased, and said: For what purpose was this waste?
<verse eID="Matt.26.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.9" osisID="Matt.26.9" n="9" />For this could have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
<verse eID="Matt.26.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.10" osisID="Matt.26.10" n="10" />Jesus perceived it, and said to them: Why do you trouble the woman? For she has performed a good work upon me.
<verse eID="Matt.26.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.11" osisID="Matt.26.11" n="11" />For you have the poor always with you, but me you have not always.
<verse eID="Matt.26.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.12" osisID="Matt.26.12" n="12" />For in pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial.
<verse eID="Matt.26.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.13" osisID="Matt.26.13" n="13" />Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, this also which she has done shall be told for a memorial of her.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.14" osisID="Matt.26.14" n="14" />Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
<verse eID="Matt.26.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.15" osisID="Matt.26.15" n="15" />and said: What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they weighed to him thirty pieces of silver.
<verse eID="Matt.26.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.16" osisID="Matt.26.16" n="16" />And from that time he sought an opportunity to deliver him up.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.17" osisID="Matt.26.17" n="17" />On the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, and said to him: Where dost thou wish that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
<verse eID="Matt.26.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.18" osisID="Matt.26.18" n="18" />He replied: Go into the city, to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the passover at your house, with my disciples.
<verse eID="Matt.26.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.19" osisID="Matt.26.19" n="19" />And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and prepared the passover.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.20" osisID="Matt.26.20" n="20" />When the evening had come, he reclined at table with the twelve.
<verse eID="Matt.26.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.21" osisID="Matt.26.21" n="21" />And as they were eating, he said: Verily I say to you, One of you will deliver me up.
<verse eID="Matt.26.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.22" osisID="Matt.26.22" n="22" />And they were very sad, and began each one of them to say to him: Lord, is it I?
<verse eID="Matt.26.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.23" osisID="Matt.26.23" n="23" />He answered and said: He that dips his hand with me in the dish, will deliver me up.
<verse eID="Matt.26.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.24" osisID="Matt.26.24" n="24" />The Son of man goes, as it is written of him; but alas for that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! It would have been good for that man, if he had not been born.
<verse eID="Matt.26.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.25" osisID="Matt.26.25" n="25" />And Judas, who delivered him up, answered and said: Rabbi, is it I? He replied: You have said.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.26" osisID="Matt.26.26" n="26" />And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said: Take, eat; this is my body.
<verse eID="Matt.26.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.27" osisID="Matt.26.27" n="27" />And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: Do you all drink of it:
<verse eID="Matt.26.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.28" osisID="Matt.26.28" n="28" />for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many in order to the remission of sins.
<verse eID="Matt.26.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.29" osisID="Matt.26.29" n="29" />But I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, till that day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.30" osisID="Matt.26.30" n="30" />And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
<verse eID="Matt.26.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.31" osisID="Matt.26.31" n="31" />Then Jesus said to them: All of you will he offended at me this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.
<verse eID="Matt.26.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.32" osisID="Matt.26.32" n="32" />But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
<verse eID="Matt.26.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.33" osisID="Matt.26.33" n="33" />Peter answered and said to him: Though all shall be offended at thee, yet will I never be offended.
<verse eID="Matt.26.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.34" osisID="Matt.26.34" n="34" />Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, This night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.
<verse eID="Matt.26.34" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.35" osisID="Matt.26.35" n="35" />Peter said to him: Though it should be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee. In like manner said all the disciples.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.35" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.36" osisID="Matt.26.36" n="36" />Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples: Sit here, till I go and pray yonder.
<verse eID="Matt.26.36" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.37" osisID="Matt.26.37" n="37" />And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be in deep distress and anguish of soul.
<verse eID="Matt.26.37" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.38" osisID="Matt.26.38" n="38" />Then Jesus said to them: My soul is encompassed with sorrow even to death; remain here, and watch with me.
<verse eID="Matt.26.38" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.39" osisID="Matt.26.39" n="39" />And he went forward a little, and fell on his face in prayer, saying: My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as thou willest.
<verse eID="Matt.26.39" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.40" osisID="Matt.26.40" n="40" />And he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter: Was it so, that you had not strength to watch with me one hour?
<verse eID="Matt.26.40" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.41" osisID="Matt.26.41" n="41" />Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit is, willing, but the flesh is weak.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.41" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.42" osisID="Matt.26.42" n="42" />Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed, saying: My Father, if this cup cannot pass from me, unless I drink it, thy will be done.
<verse eID="Matt.26.42" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.43" osisID="Matt.26.43" n="43" />And he came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.
<verse eID="Matt.26.43" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.44" osisID="Matt.26.44" n="44" />And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
<verse eID="Matt.26.44" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.45" osisID="Matt.26.45" n="45" />Then he came to his disciples, and said to them: Bleep what time is left, and take your rest; behold, the hour draws near, and the Son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
<verse eID="Matt.26.45" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.46" osisID="Matt.26.46" n="46" />Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up is at hand.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.46" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.47" osisID="Matt.26.47" n="47" />And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.
<verse eID="Matt.26.47" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.48" osisID="Matt.26.48" n="48" />He that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying: The one that I shall kiss is he; hold him fast.
<verse eID="Matt.26.48" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.49" osisID="Matt.26.49" n="49" />And immediately he came to Jesus, and said: Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.
<verse eID="Matt.26.49" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.50" osisID="Matt.26.50" n="50" />Jesus said to him: Friend, for what purpose have you come? Then they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him fast.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.50" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.51" osisID="Matt.26.51" n="51" />And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.
<verse eID="Matt.26.51" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.52" osisID="Matt.26.52" n="52" />Then Jesus said to him: Put back your sword into its place; for all that take the sword, shall perish by the sword.
<verse eID="Matt.26.52" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.53" osisID="Matt.26.53" n="53" />Do you think that I can not now call upon my Father, and he would cause more than twelve legions of angels to stand by me?
<verse eID="Matt.26.53" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.54" osisID="Matt.26.54" n="54" />But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.54" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.55" osisID="Matt.26.55" n="55" />At the same time Jesus said to the multitudes: Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I sat daily with you in the temple and taught, and you did not take me.
<verse eID="Matt.26.55" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.56" osisID="Matt.26.56" n="56" />All this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.56" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.57" osisID="Matt.26.57" n="57" />And those who took Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and elders had come together.
<verse eID="Matt.26.57" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.58" osisID="Matt.26.58" n="58" />But Peter followed him, at a distance, to the palace of the chief priest, and went in and sat with the attendants, to see the end.
<verse eID="Matt.26.58" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.59" osisID="Matt.26.59" n="59" />And the chief priests and the elders, and the whole Sanhedrin, sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death,
<verse eID="Matt.26.59" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.60" osisID="Matt.26.60" n="60" />and found none. Though many false witnesses came, yet they found none. At last two false witnesses came,
<verse eID="Matt.26.60" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.61" osisID="Matt.26.61" n="61" />and said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
<verse eID="Matt.26.61" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.62" osisID="Matt.26.62" n="62" />And the chief priest arose, and said to him: Do you make no answer? What do these testify against you?
<verse eID="Matt.26.62" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.63" osisID="Matt.26.63" n="63" />But Jesus remained silent.
</p>
<p>
And the chief priest answered and said to him: I adjure you, by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God?
<verse eID="Matt.26.63" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.64" osisID="Matt.26.64" n="64" />Jesus said to him: You have said. Moreover, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.
<verse eID="Matt.26.64" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.65" osisID="Matt.26.65" n="65" />Then the chief priest rent his clothes, and said: He has spoken impiously; what further need have we of witnesses? See now, you have heard his impious words:
<verse eID="Matt.26.65" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.66" osisID="Matt.26.66" n="66" />What think you? They answered and said: He is a subject for death.
<verse eID="Matt.26.66" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.67" osisID="Matt.26.67" n="67" />Then did they spit in his face, and strike him with their fists; some struck him with the open hand,
<verse eID="Matt.26.67" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.68" osisID="Matt.26.68" n="68" />and said: Give a response to us, Christ: Who is he that struck you?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.26.68" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.69" osisID="Matt.26.69" n="69" />But Peter was sitting without in the court; and a maid-servant came to him, and said: You also were with Jesus of Galilee.
<verse eID="Matt.26.69" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.70" osisID="Matt.26.70" n="70" />But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what you say.
<verse eID="Matt.26.70" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.71" osisID="Matt.26.71" n="71" />And when he went out into the entrance, another maid-servant saw him, and said to those who were there: This man was also with Jesus the Nazarene.
<verse eID="Matt.26.71" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.72" osisID="Matt.26.72" n="72" />And again he denied, with an oath: I know not the man.
<verse eID="Matt.26.72" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.73" osisID="Matt.26.73" n="73" />After a little while, those who stood by came and said to Peter: Of a truth you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you.
<verse eID="Matt.26.73" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.74" osisID="Matt.26.74" n="74" />Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
<verse eID="Matt.26.74" />
<verse sID="Matt.26.75" osisID="Matt.26.75" n="75" />And Peter remembered the word which. Jesus had spoken to him: Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

<verse sID="Matt.27.2" osisID="Matt.27.2" n="2" />And they bound him and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.3" osisID="Matt.27.3" n="3" />Then Judas, who had delivered him up, when he saw that he was condemned, stung by remorse, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
<verse eID="Matt.27.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.4" osisID="Matt.27.4" n="4" />saying: I have sinned in having delivered up innocent blood. They replied: What is that to us? You will see to that.
<verse eID="Matt.27.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.5" osisID="Matt.27.5" n="5" />And he threw down the money in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
<verse eID="Matt.27.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.6" osisID="Matt.27.6" n="6" />And the chief priests took the money, and said: It is not lawful to put it into the sacred treasury, because it is the price of blood.
<verse eID="Matt.27.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.7" osisID="Matt.27.7" n="7" />And they took counsel, and bought with it the potter’s field, as a burial-place for foreigners.
<verse eID="Matt.27.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.8" osisID="Matt.27.8" n="8" />For this reason, that field is called the field of blood, to this day.
<verse eID="Matt.27.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.9" osisID="Matt.27.9" n="9" />Then the word was fulfilled which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that had a price set upon him, on whom some of the children of Israel did set a price,
<verse eID="Matt.27.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.10" osisID="Matt.27.10" n="10" />and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.11" osisID="Matt.27.11" n="11" />And Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, saying: Are you the king of the Jews? Jesus replied to him: You say it.
<verse eID="Matt.27.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.12" osisID="Matt.27.12" n="12" />And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.
<verse eID="Matt.27.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.13" osisID="Matt.27.13" n="13" />Then Pilate said to him: Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?
<verse eID="Matt.27.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.14" osisID="Matt.27.14" n="14" />And he gave him answer to not one word, so that the governor was greatly astonished.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.15" osisID="Matt.27.15" n="15" />Now at the feast, the governor was in the habit of releasing to the multitude one prisoner, whom they chose.
<verse eID="Matt.27.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.16" osisID="Matt.27.16" n="16" />They then had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
<verse eID="Matt.27.16" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.17" osisID="Matt.27.17" n="17" />Therefore, while they were together, Pilate said to them: Which do you wish me to release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?
<verse eID="Matt.27.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.18" osisID="Matt.27.18" n="18" />For he knew that through envy they had delivered him up.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.18" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.19" osisID="Matt.27.19" n="19" />While he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying: Have nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered much to-day in a dream, because of him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.19" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.20" osisID="Matt.27.20" n="20" />But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude to ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
<verse eID="Matt.27.20" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.21" osisID="Matt.27.21" n="21" />The governor answered and said to them: Which of the two do you wish me to release to you? They replied: Barabbas.
<verse eID="Matt.27.21" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.22" osisID="Matt.27.22" n="22" />Pilate said to them: What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said to him: Let him be crucified.
<verse eID="Matt.27.22" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.23" osisID="Matt.27.23" n="23" />But the governor said: Why, what evil has he done? But they cried vehemently, saying: Let him be crucified.
<verse eID="Matt.27.23" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.24" osisID="Matt.27.24" n="24" />When Pilate saw that he gained nothing, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, and said: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; you will see to it.
<verse eID="Matt.27.24" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.25" osisID="Matt.27.25" n="25" />And all the people answered and said: His blood be upon us and upon our children.
<verse eID="Matt.27.25" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.26" osisID="Matt.27.26" n="26" />Then he released to them Barabbas; but after he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him up to be crucified.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.26" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.27" osisID="Matt.27.27" n="27" />Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the palace, and brought together to him the whole band.
<verse eID="Matt.27.27" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.28" osisID="Matt.27.28" n="28" />And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet cloak;
<verse eID="Matt.27.28" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.29" osisID="Matt.27.29" n="29" />and when they had plaited a crown of thorn branches, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and kneeling before him, they derided him, saying: Hail, King of the Jews!
<verse eID="Matt.27.29" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.30" osisID="Matt.27.30" n="30" />And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and struck him on the head.
<verse eID="Matt.27.30" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.31" osisID="Matt.27.31" n="31" />And when they had derided him, they took off the cloak from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.31" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.32" osisID="Matt.27.32" n="32" />And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: this man they compelled to carry his cross.
<verse eID="Matt.27.32" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.33" osisID="Matt.27.33" n="33" />And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, which, when translated, is the place of a skull,
<verse eID="Matt.27.33" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.34" osisID="Matt.27.34" n="34" />they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall; and when he had tasted it, he refused to drink.
<verse eID="Matt.27.34" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.35" osisID="Matt.27.35" n="35" />And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among themselves, by casting the lot.
<verse eID="Matt.27.35" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.36" osisID="Matt.27.36" n="36" />And they sat down and watched him there.
<verse eID="Matt.27.36" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.37" osisID="Matt.27.37" n="37" />And they placed above his head the charge that was made against him, written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<verse eID="Matt.27.37" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.38" osisID="Matt.27.38" n="38" />Then were two robbers crucified with him; one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.38" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.39" osisID="Matt.27.39" n="39" />And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads,
<verse eID="Matt.27.39" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.40" osisID="Matt.27.40" n="40" />and saying: You that destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself; if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.
<verse eID="Matt.27.40" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.41" osisID="Matt.27.41" n="41" />In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, derided him, and said:
<verse eID="Matt.27.41" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.42" osisID="Matt.27.42" n="42" />He saved others; himself he can not save. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.
<verse eID="Matt.27.42" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.43" osisID="Matt.27.43" n="43" />He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he delights in him; for he said: I am the Son of God.
<verse eID="Matt.27.43" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.44" osisID="Matt.27.44" n="44" />The robbers also that were crucified with him, uttered the same reproaches against him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.44" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.45" osisID="Matt.27.45" n="45" />From the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land till the ninth hour.
<verse eID="Matt.27.45" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.46" osisID="Matt.27.46" n="46" />But about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamah sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
<verse eID="Matt.27.46" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.47" osisID="Matt.27.47" n="47" />Some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said: This man calls for Elijah.
<verse eID="Matt.27.47" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.48" osisID="Matt.27.48" n="48" />And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and having filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.
<verse eID="Matt.27.48" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.49" osisID="Matt.27.49" n="49" />The rest said: Wait, let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.49" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.50" osisID="Matt.27.50" n="50" />And Jesus again cried with a loud voice, and gave up his spirit.
<verse eID="Matt.27.50" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.51" osisID="Matt.27.51" n="51" />And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in two from top to bottom. And the earth did shake, and the rocks were rent:
<verse eID="Matt.27.51" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.52" osisID="Matt.27.52" n="52" />and the sepulchers were opened, and many bodies of the saints that slept, arose.
<verse eID="Matt.27.52" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.53" osisID="Matt.27.53" n="53" />And they came out of their sepulchers after his resurrection, and entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.53" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.54" osisID="Matt.27.54" n="54" />Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and what was done, were greatly afraid, and said: Of a truth, this was the Son of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.54" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.55" osisID="Matt.27.55" n="55" />Many women that had followed Jesus from Galilee, and had ministered to him, were there, looking on from a distance.
<verse eID="Matt.27.55" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.56" osisID="Matt.27.56" n="56" />Among these was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.56" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.57" osisID="Matt.27.57" n="57" />When the evening had come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph; and he also was a disciple of Jesus.
<verse eID="Matt.27.57" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.58" osisID="Matt.27.58" n="58" />This man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given.
<verse eID="Matt.27.58" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.59" osisID="Matt.27.59" n="59" />And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen,
<verse eID="Matt.27.59" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.60" osisID="Matt.27.60" n="60" />and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
<verse eID="Matt.27.60" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.61" osisID="Matt.27.61" n="61" />And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.27.61" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.62" osisID="Matt.27.62" n="62" />On the morrow, which was the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,
<verse eID="Matt.27.62" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.63" osisID="Matt.27.63" n="63" />and said: Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will arise.
<verse eID="Matt.27.63" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.64" osisID="Matt.27.64" n="64" />Therefore, command that the sepulcher be made safe till the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people, He has risen from the dead; and the last error will be worse than the first.
<verse eID="Matt.27.64" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.65" osisID="Matt.27.65" n="65" />Pilate said to them: You have a guard; go, make it as safe as you know how.
<verse eID="Matt.27.65" />
<verse sID="Matt.27.66" osisID="Matt.27.66" n="66" />And they went and made the sepulcher safe, by placing a seal upon the stone, and setting the guard.

<chapter sID="Matt.28" osisID="Matt.28" n="28" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.1" osisID="Matt.28.1" n="1" />And after the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the sepulcher.
<verse eID="Matt.28.1" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.2" osisID="Matt.28.2" n="2" />And behold, there had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord having descended from heaven, came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
<verse eID="Matt.28.2" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.3" osisID="Matt.28.3" n="3" />His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment was white as snow.
<verse eID="Matt.28.3" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.4" osisID="Matt.28.4" n="4" />From fear of him the keepers did shake and become like dead men.
<verse eID="Matt.28.4" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.5" osisID="Matt.28.5" n="5" />But the angel answered and said to the women: Fear not; for I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified.
<verse eID="Matt.28.5" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.6" osisID="Matt.28.6" n="6" />He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
<verse eID="Matt.28.6" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.7" osisID="Matt.28.7" n="7" />And go quickly, and tell his disciples, that he has risen from the dead: and behold, he goes before you into Galilee. There you shall see him. Lo, I have told you.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.28.7" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.8" osisID="Matt.28.8" n="8" />And they went out quickly from the sepulcher, with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
<verse eID="Matt.28.8" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.9" osisID="Matt.28.9" n="9" />And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying: Hail! And they came and laid hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
<verse eID="Matt.28.9" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.10" osisID="Matt.28.10" n="10" />Then Jesus said to them: Fear not; go, tell my brethren to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.28.10" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.11" osisID="Matt.28.11" n="11" />While they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told the chief priests all things that were done.
<verse eID="Matt.28.11" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.12" osisID="Matt.28.12" n="12" />And when they came together with the elders, they held a consultation, and gave much money to the soldiers,
<verse eID="Matt.28.12" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.13" osisID="Matt.28.13" n="13" />saying: Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away, while we were asleep.
<verse eID="Matt.28.13" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.14" osisID="Matt.28.14" n="14" />And if this shall be heard in the presence of the governor, we will persuade him, and make you secure.
<verse eID="Matt.28.14" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.15" osisID="Matt.28.15" n="15" />And they took the money, and did as they were taught. And their report of this matter is everywhere published among the Jews to this day.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Matt.28.15" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.16" osisID="Matt.28.16" n="16" />And the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into the mountain, where Jesus had appointed <transChange type="added">to meet</transChange> them.

<verse sID="Matt.28.17" osisID="Matt.28.17" n="17" />And when they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.
<verse eID="Matt.28.17" />
<verse sID="Matt.28.18" osisID="Matt.28.18" n="18" />And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying: All authority in heaven and on earth is given to me.

<verse sID="Mark.1.1" osisID="Mark.1.1" n="1" />The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
<verse eID="Mark.1.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.2" osisID="Mark.1.2" n="2" />as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way.
<verse eID="Mark.1.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.3" osisID="Mark.1.3" n="3" />The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
<verse eID="Mark.1.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.4" osisID="Mark.1.4" n="4" />John was immersing in the wilderness, and preaching the immersion of repentance in order to the remission of sins.
<verse eID="Mark.1.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.5" osisID="Mark.1.5" n="5" />And all the country of Judea and the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him, and were all immersed by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
<verse eID="Mark.1.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.6" osisID="Mark.1.6" n="6" />And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and had a girdle of leather around his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey:
<verse eID="Mark.1.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.7" osisID="Mark.1.7" n="7" />and he preached, saying: There comes after me One mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.
<verse eID="Mark.1.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.8" osisID="Mark.1.8" n="8" />I immerse you in water; but he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.1.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.9" osisID="Mark.1.9" n="9" />And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed by John in the Jordan.
<verse eID="Mark.1.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.10" osisID="Mark.1.10" n="10" />And immediately on coming up from the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.
<verse eID="Mark.1.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.11" osisID="Mark.1.11" n="11" />And there was a voice from the heavens: Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I delight.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.1.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.12" osisID="Mark.1.12" n="12" />And immediately the Spirit compelled him to go forth into the wilderness.
<verse eID="Mark.1.12" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.13" osisID="Mark.1.13" n="13" />And he was there in the wilderness forty days, to be tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.1.13" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.14" osisID="Mark.1.14" n="14" />But after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
<verse eID="Mark.1.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.15" osisID="Mark.1.15" n="15" />and saying: The time has fully come, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the gospel.
<verse eID="Mark.1.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.16" osisID="Mark.1.16" n="16" />And as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew the brother of Simon, throwing a net about in the sea; for they were fishers.
<verse eID="Mark.1.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.17" osisID="Mark.1.17" n="17" />And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
<verse eID="Mark.1.17" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.18" osisID="Mark.1.18" n="18" />And immediately they left their nets, and followed him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.1.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.19" osisID="Mark.1.19" n="19" />And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship, mending their nets.
<verse eID="Mark.1.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.20" osisID="Mark.1.20" n="20" />And he immediately called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.

<verse sID="Mark.1.21" osisID="Mark.1.21" n="21" />And they went into Capernaum; and immediately, on the sabbath, he entered the synagogue, and taught.
<verse eID="Mark.1.21" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.22" osisID="Mark.1.22" n="22" />And they were astonished at his teaching; for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
<verse eID="Mark.1.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.23" osisID="Mark.1.23" n="23" />And there was in their synagogue a man who had an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
<verse eID="Mark.1.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.24" osisID="Mark.1.24" n="24" />saying: Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Nazarene? Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
<verse eID="Mark.1.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.25" osisID="Mark.1.25" n="25" />And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Be silent, and come out of him.
<verse eID="Mark.1.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.26" osisID="Mark.1.26" n="26" />And the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions, and cried with a loud voice, and came out of him.
<verse eID="Mark.1.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.27" osisID="Mark.1.27" n="27" />And all were amazed, so that they questioned one another, saying: What means this? What new teaching is this, that with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him?
<verse eID="Mark.1.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.28" osisID="Mark.1.28" n="28" />And his fame immediately went abroad into all the surrounding country of Galilee.

<verse eID="Mark.1.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.31" osisID="Mark.1.31" n="31" />And he went to her, and took her by the hand, and raised her up, and the fever left her instantly; and she ministered to them.

<verse eID="Mark.1.34" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.35" osisID="Mark.1.35" n="35" />And very early in the morning, while it was yet dark, he arose and went out, and departed to a desert place, and there prayed.

<verse eID="Mark.1.38" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.39" osisID="Mark.1.39" n="39" />And throughout the whole of Galilee he continued to preach in their synagogues, and to cast out demons.

<verse sID="Mark.1.41" osisID="Mark.1.41" n="41" />And Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him: I will; be clean.
<verse eID="Mark.1.41" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.42" osisID="Mark.1.42" n="42" />And when he had spoken, the leprosy immediately departed from him, and he was cleansed.
<verse eID="Mark.1.42" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.43" osisID="Mark.1.43" n="43" />And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away,
<verse eID="Mark.1.43" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.44" osisID="Mark.1.44" n="44" />and said to him: See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
<verse eID="Mark.1.44" />
<verse sID="Mark.1.45" osisID="Mark.1.45" n="45" />But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to publish the matter abroad, so that he was no longer able to enter a city openly, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.

<verse eID="Mark.2.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.8" osisID="Mark.2.8" n="8" />And Jesus, immediately perceiving in his spirit that they thus reasoned within themselves, said to them: Why are you reasoning thus in your hearts?
<verse eID="Mark.2.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.2.9" osisID="Mark.2.9" n="9" />Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, take up your bed and walk?

<verse sID="Mark.4.22" osisID="Mark.4.22" n="22" />For there is nothing hid that shall not be made known; nor has any thing been concealed, but that it may come into open view.
<verse eID="Mark.4.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.23" osisID="Mark.4.23" n="23" />If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.
<verse eID="Mark.4.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.24" osisID="Mark.4.24" n="24" />And he said to them: Take heed how you hear; with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you; and to you that hear, more shall be given;
<verse eID="Mark.4.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.25" osisID="Mark.4.25" n="25" />for whoever has, to him shall be given; and whoever has not, even that which he has shall be taken from him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.4.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.26" osisID="Mark.4.26" n="26" />And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should sow seed in the ground,
<verse eID="Mark.4.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.27" osisID="Mark.4.27" n="27" />and should sleep and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knows not how.
<verse eID="Mark.4.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.28" osisID="Mark.4.28" n="28" />For the earth, of its own accord, produces fruit, first the blade; then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
<verse eID="Mark.4.28" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.29" osisID="Mark.4.29" n="29" />But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest is ready.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.4.29" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.30" osisID="Mark.4.30" n="30" />And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or, by what similitude shall we illustrate it?
<verse eID="Mark.4.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.31" osisID="Mark.4.31" n="31" />It is like a grain of mustard, which, when it is sown in the ground, is less than all seeds that are in the ground;
<verse eID="Mark.4.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.32" osisID="Mark.4.32" n="32" />yet, when it is sown, it grows up, and becomes larger than all garden-plants, and sends out great branches, so that the birds of the air can roost under its shadow.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.4.32" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.33" osisID="Mark.4.33" n="33" />And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.
<verse eID="Mark.4.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.34" osisID="Mark.4.34" n="34" />But without a parable he did not speak to them; but when alone, he explained all things to his disciples.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.4.34" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.35" osisID="Mark.4.35" n="35" />And on the same day, when it was evening, he said to them: Let us go over to the opposite side.
<verse eID="Mark.4.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.36" osisID="Mark.4.36" n="36" />And when they had sent the multitude away, they took him with them, as he was in the ship; and there were other little ships with him.
<verse eID="Mark.4.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.37" osisID="Mark.4.37" n="37" />And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves dashed into the ship, so that it was now full.
<verse eID="Mark.4.37" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.38" osisID="Mark.4.38" n="38" />And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on the pillow. And they awoke him, and said to him: Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?
<verse eID="Mark.4.38" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.39" osisID="Mark.4.39" n="39" />And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
<verse eID="Mark.4.39" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.40" osisID="Mark.4.40" n="40" />And he said to them: Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?
<verse eID="Mark.4.40" />
<verse sID="Mark.4.41" osisID="Mark.4.41" n="41" />And they were greatly afraid, and said one to another: Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?

<verse eID="Mark.5.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.2" osisID="Mark.5.2" n="2" />And when he had come out of the ship, immediately there met him from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
<verse eID="Mark.5.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.3" osisID="Mark.5.3" n="3" />who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could keep him bound even with chains;
<verse eID="Mark.5.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.4" osisID="Mark.5.4" n="4" />because he had often been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been pulled to pieces by him, and the fetters had been broken, and no one had strength to subdue him;
<verse eID="Mark.5.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.5" osisID="Mark.5.5" n="5" />and always, night and day, he was in the tombs, and in the mountains, crying out, and cutting himself with stones.

<verse eID="Mark.5.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.7" osisID="Mark.5.7" n="7" />and crying out with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
<verse eID="Mark.5.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.8" osisID="Mark.5.8" n="8" />For he had said to him: Unclean spirit, come out of the man.
<verse eID="Mark.5.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.9" osisID="Mark.5.9" n="9" />And he asked him: What is your name? And he said to him: My name is Legion; for we are many.
<verse eID="Mark.5.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.10" osisID="Mark.5.10" n="10" />And he earnestly besought him that he would not send them out of the country.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.5.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.11" osisID="Mark.5.11" n="11" />Now a great herd of swine was feeding there near the mountain.
<verse eID="Mark.5.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.12" osisID="Mark.5.12" n="12" />And the demons besought him, saying: Send us to the swine, that we may enter into them.
<verse eID="Mark.5.12" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.13" osisID="Mark.5.13" n="13" />And Jesus immediately gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the swine; and the herd (they were about two thousand,) rushed down a steep place into the sea, and were strangled in the sea.
<verse eID="Mark.5.13" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.14" osisID="Mark.5.14" n="14" />And those who fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came out to see what had been done;
<verse eID="Mark.5.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.15" osisID="Mark.5.15" n="15" />and they came to Jesus and saw the demoniac, who had had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.5.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.16" osisID="Mark.5.16" n="16" />And those who had seen it told them how it had happened to the demoniac, and also concerning the swine.
<verse eID="Mark.5.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.17" osisID="Mark.5.17" n="17" />And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders.

<verse eID="Mark.5.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.19" osisID="Mark.5.19" n="19" />And he did not permit him, but said to him: Go home to your relatives, and make known to them what things the Lord has done for you, and that he has had compassion on you.
<verse eID="Mark.5.19" />

<verse eID="Mark.5.21" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.22" osisID="Mark.5.22" n="22" />And behold, there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,
<verse eID="Mark.5.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.23" osisID="Mark.5.23" n="23" />and besought him earnestly, saying: My little daughter is at the point of death; come, lay thy hands on her, that she may be saved, and she will live.
<verse eID="Mark.5.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.24" osisID="Mark.5.24" n="24" />And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and pressed upon him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.5.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.25" osisID="Mark.5.25" n="25" />And a certain woman who had had an issue of blood for twelve years,
<verse eID="Mark.5.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.26" osisID="Mark.5.26" n="26" />and had suffered much from many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was in no way benefited, but rather grew worse,
<verse eID="Mark.5.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.27" osisID="Mark.5.27" n="27" />when she heard of Jesus, came behind him in the multitude, and touched his mantle;
<verse eID="Mark.5.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.28" osisID="Mark.5.28" n="28" />for she said: If I may even touch his clothes, I shall be saved.
<verse eID="Mark.5.28" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.29" osisID="Mark.5.29" n="29" />And immediately the fountain of her blood dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured of that plague.
<verse eID="Mark.5.29" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.30" osisID="Mark.5.30" n="30" />And Jesus, immediately perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him, turned around in the multitude and said: Who touched my clothes?
<verse eID="Mark.5.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.31" osisID="Mark.5.31" n="31" />And his disciples said to him: Thou seest the multitude pressing upon thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me?

<verse eID="Mark.5.32" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.33" osisID="Mark.5.33" n="33" />But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing; what had been done within her, came and fell down before him; and told him all the truth.
<verse eID="Mark.5.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.34" osisID="Mark.5.34" n="34" />And he said to her: Daughter, your faith has saved you; go in peace, and be cured of your plague.

<verse sID="Mark.5.36" osisID="Mark.5.36" n="36" />But as soon as Jesus heard what was spoken, he said to the ruler of the synagogue: Fear not, only believe.
<verse eID="Mark.5.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.37" osisID="Mark.5.37" n="37" />And he suffered no one to follow him, except Peter and James and John the brother of James.

<verse sID="Mark.5.39" osisID="Mark.5.39" n="39" />And he went in and said to them: Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeps.
<verse eID="Mark.5.39" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.40" osisID="Mark.5.40" n="40" />And they derided him. But when he had put them all out, he took the father and mother of the child, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
<verse eID="Mark.5.40" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.41" osisID="Mark.5.41" n="41" />And he took the child by the hand, and said to her: Talitha kumi; which is, when translated, Maiden, (I say to you,) arise.
<verse eID="Mark.5.41" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.42" osisID="Mark.5.42" n="42" />And the maiden immediately arose and walked, for she was twelve years old. And they were greatly astonished.
<verse eID="Mark.5.42" />
<verse sID="Mark.5.43" osisID="Mark.5.43" n="43" />And he charged them strictly that no one should know this. And he commanded that something should be given her to eat.

<verse sID="Mark.6.2" osisID="Mark.6.2" n="2" />And when the sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many that heard him were astonished, and said: Whence has this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty deeds are done by his hands?
<verse eID="Mark.6.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.3" osisID="Mark.6.3" n="3" />Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses and Judah and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they found in him cause for offense.

<verse sID="Mark.6.11" osisID="Mark.6.11" n="11" />And whoever will not receive you, nor hear you, when you go out from that place, shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against them.

<verse eID="Mark.6.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.37" osisID="Mark.6.37" n="37" />He answered and said to them: Do you give them food. And they said to him: Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them food?
<verse eID="Mark.6.37" />
<verse sID="Mark.6.38" osisID="Mark.6.38" n="38" />He said to them: How many loaves have you? Go and see. And when they had learned, they said: Five, and two fishes.

<verse eID="Mark.11.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.11.24" osisID="Mark.11.24" n="24" />For this reason I say to you: All things that you ask for in prayer, believe that you will receive them, and they shall be yours.
<verse eID="Mark.11.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.11.25" osisID="Mark.11.25" n="25" />And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have any thing against any one, that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your offenses.
<verse eID="Mark.11.25" />

<verse sID="Mark.12.1" osisID="Mark.12.1" n="1" />And he began to speak to them in parables: A man planted a vineyard, and set a hedge around it, and digged a wine-press, and built a tower, and let it out to vine-dressers, and went into another country.
<verse eID="Mark.12.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.2" osisID="Mark.12.2" n="2" />And at the proper time, he sent a servant to the vine-dressers, that he might receive from the vine-dressers of the fruit of the vineyard.
<verse eID="Mark.12.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.3" osisID="Mark.12.3" n="3" />And they took him and scourged him, and sent him away without any thing.
<verse eID="Mark.12.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.4" osisID="Mark.12.4" n="4" />And again he sent to them another servant; and at him they threw stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.
<verse eID="Mark.12.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.5" osisID="Mark.12.5" n="5" />And again he sent another; and him they killed. And he sent many others, some of whom they scourged, and some they killed.
<verse eID="Mark.12.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.6" osisID="Mark.12.6" n="6" />Therefore, having yet one son, his beloved, he sent him also to them last, saying, They will reverence my son.
<verse eID="Mark.12.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.7" osisID="Mark.12.7" n="7" />But those vine-dressers said one to another, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.
<verse eID="Mark.12.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.8" osisID="Mark.12.8" n="8" />And they took him, and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
<verse eID="Mark.12.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.9" osisID="Mark.12.9" n="9" />What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those vine-dressers, and give his vineyard to others.

<verse eID="Mark.12.13" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.14" osisID="Mark.12.14" n="14" />And they came and said to him: Teacher, we know that you are true, and that you care for no one; for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?
<verse eID="Mark.12.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.15" osisID="Mark.12.15" n="15" />Must we give, or must we not give? But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them: Why do you tempt me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.

<verse sID="Mark.12.18" osisID="Mark.12.18" n="18" />And the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him, and put a question to him, saying:
<verse eID="Mark.12.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.19" osisID="Mark.12.19" n="19" />Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If any man’s brother die, and leave a wife, and leave no children, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up children for his brother.
<verse eID="Mark.12.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.20" osisID="Mark.12.20" n="20" />Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and dying, left no child;
<verse eID="Mark.12.20" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.21" osisID="Mark.12.21" n="21" />and the second took her, and he died, and left no child; and the third, likewise;
<verse eID="Mark.12.21" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.22" osisID="Mark.12.22" n="22" />and the seven took her, and left no child. Last of all, the woman also died.
<verse eID="Mark.12.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.23" osisID="Mark.12.23" n="23" />Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, of which of them shall she be the wife? for the seven had her as a wife.
<verse eID="Mark.12.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.24" osisID="Mark.12.24" n="24" />And Jesus answered and said to them: Do you not err for this reason, because you know not the scriptures, nor the power of God?
<verse eID="Mark.12.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.25" osisID="Mark.12.25" n="25" />For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven.
<verse eID="Mark.12.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.26" osisID="Mark.12.26" n="26" />But concerning the dead, that they do rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, at The Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
<verse eID="Mark.12.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.27" osisID="Mark.12.27" n="27" />He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Therefore, you do greatly err.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.12.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.28" osisID="Mark.12.28" n="28" />And one of the scribes came, and heard them reasoning together; and perceiving that he had answered them well, he asked him: Which is the first commandment of all?
<verse eID="Mark.12.28" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.29" osisID="Mark.12.29" n="29" />And Jesus answered him: The first commandment of all is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
<verse eID="Mark.12.29" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.30" osisID="Mark.12.30" n="30" />And you shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind, and with your whole strength. This is the first commandment.
<verse eID="Mark.12.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.31" osisID="Mark.12.31" n="31" />And the second, which is like it, is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.
<verse eID="Mark.12.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.32" osisID="Mark.12.32" n="32" />And the scribe said to him: Teacher, in truth you have well said, that there is one God, and there is no other beside him;
<verse eID="Mark.12.32" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.33" osisID="Mark.12.33" n="33" />and to love him with the whole heart, and with the whole understanding, and with the whole soul, and with the whole strength, and to love one’s neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
<verse eID="Mark.12.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.34" osisID="Mark.12.34" n="34" />And Jesus perceiving that he answered with understanding, said to him: You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no one, after that, ventured to ask him a question.

<p>
<verse eID="Mark.12.34" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.35" osisID="Mark.12.35" n="35" />And Jesus, as he was teaching in the temple, answered and said: How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David?
<verse eID="Mark.12.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.36" osisID="Mark.12.36" n="36" />For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
<verse eID="Mark.12.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.37" osisID="Mark.12.37" n="37" />David himself, then, calls him Lord; and how is he his son? And the great multitude heard him with pleasure.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.12.37" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.38" osisID="Mark.12.38" n="38" />And he said to them in his teaching: Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in robes, and love salutations in the markets,

<verse sID="Mark.12.39" osisID="Mark.12.39" n="39" />and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first places at suppers;

</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.12.40" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.41" osisID="Mark.12.41" n="41" />And Jesus, sitting opposite the treasury, observed how the multitude threw money into the treasury. And many rich persons threw in much.
<verse eID="Mark.12.41" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.42" osisID="Mark.12.42" n="42" />And there came one poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
<verse eID="Mark.12.42" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.43" osisID="Mark.12.43" n="43" />And he called his disciples to him, and said to them: Verily I say to you, this poor widow has thrown in more than all that have thrown into the treasury.
<verse eID="Mark.12.43" />
<verse sID="Mark.12.44" osisID="Mark.12.44" n="44" />For all have thrown in out of their abundance; but she, out of her poverty, has thrown in all that she had, her whole living.

<verse sID="Mark.14.10" osisID="Mark.14.10" n="10" />And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him up to them.
<verse eID="Mark.14.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.11" osisID="Mark.14.11" n="11" />And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him up.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.12" osisID="Mark.14.12" n="12" />And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him: Where dost thou wish that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
<verse eID="Mark.14.12" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.13" osisID="Mark.14.13" n="13" />And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them: Go into the city, and there will meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water;
<verse eID="Mark.14.13" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.14" osisID="Mark.14.14" n="14" />follow him, and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house: The Teacher says, Where is the room in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?
<verse eID="Mark.14.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.15" osisID="Mark.14.15" n="15" />And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and made ready; there make ready for us.
<verse eID="Mark.14.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.16" osisID="Mark.14.16" n="16" />And his disciples went out, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them; and they prepared the passover.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.17" osisID="Mark.14.17" n="17" />And in the evening, he came with the twelve.
<verse eID="Mark.14.17" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.18" osisID="Mark.14.18" n="18" />And while they were reclining at table, and were eating, Jesus said <transChange type="added">to them</transChange>: Verily I say to you, One of you, he that eats with me, will deliver me up.
<verse eID="Mark.14.18" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.19" osisID="Mark.14.19" n="19" />And they began to be sad, and to say to him, one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?
<verse eID="Mark.14.19" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.20" osisID="Mark.14.20" n="20" />He answered and said to them: It is one of the twelve, he that dips with me into the dish.
<verse eID="Mark.14.20" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.21" osisID="Mark.14.21" n="21" />The Son of man goes, as it is written of him; but alas for that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.

<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.21" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.22" osisID="Mark.14.22" n="22" />And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said: Take, eat; this is my body.
<verse eID="Mark.14.22" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.23" osisID="Mark.14.23" n="23" />And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them; and they all drank of it.
<verse eID="Mark.14.23" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.24" osisID="Mark.14.24" n="24" />And he said to them: This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.
<verse eID="Mark.14.24" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.25" osisID="Mark.14.25" n="25" />Verily I say to you, I shall drink no more of the fruit of the vine, till that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.25" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.26" osisID="Mark.14.26" n="26" />And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
<verse eID="Mark.14.26" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.27" osisID="Mark.14.27" n="27" />And Jesus said to them: All of you will find in me an occasion for offense this night; for it is written: I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
<verse eID="Mark.14.27" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.28" osisID="Mark.14.28" n="28" />But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

<verse sID="Mark.14.29" osisID="Mark.14.29" n="29" />Peter said to him: Though all should find occasion for offense, yet I will not.
<verse eID="Mark.14.29" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.30" osisID="Mark.14.30" n="30" />And Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, this day, during this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.
<verse eID="Mark.14.30" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.31" osisID="Mark.14.31" n="31" />But he said with the more vehemence: Though it should be necessary for me to die with thee, I would not deny thee. And so said they all.
<verse eID="Mark.14.31" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.32" osisID="Mark.14.32" n="32" />And they came to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples: Sit here, while I pray.
<verse eID="Mark.14.32" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.33" osisID="Mark.14.33" n="33" />And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be in dismay and anguish of soul.
<verse eID="Mark.14.33" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.34" osisID="Mark.14.34" n="34" />And he said to them: My soul is encompassed with sorrow, even to death; remain here, and watch.
<verse eID="Mark.14.34" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.35" osisID="Mark.14.35" n="35" />And he went forward a little, and fell upon the ground, and prayed, that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him;
<verse eID="Mark.14.35" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.36" osisID="Mark.14.36" n="36" />and he said: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; let this cup pass from me: but not what I will, but what thou wiliest.
<verse eID="Mark.14.36" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.37" osisID="Mark.14.37" n="37" />And he came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter: Simon, do you sleep? Had you not strength to watch one hour?
<verse eID="Mark.14.37" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.38" osisID="Mark.14.38" n="38" />Watch, and pray, <transChange type="added">all of you,</transChange> lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.38" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.39" osisID="Mark.14.39" n="39" />And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same thing.
<verse eID="Mark.14.39" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.40" osisID="Mark.14.40" n="40" />And he returned, and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what to answer him.
<verse eID="Mark.14.40" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.41" osisID="Mark.14.41" n="41" />And he came the third time, and said to them: Sleep the remaining time, and take your rest. It is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners.
<verse eID="Mark.14.41" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.42" osisID="Mark.14.42" n="42" />Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up draws near.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.42" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.43" osisID="Mark.14.43" n="43" />And immediately, while he was yet speaking, came Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
<verse eID="Mark.14.43" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.44" osisID="Mark.14.44" n="44" />And he that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying: The one that I shall kiss, is he; take him, and lead him away securely.
<verse eID="Mark.14.44" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.45" osisID="Mark.14.45" n="45" />And when he came, he immediately went up to him and said: Rabbi, Rabbi, and kissed him.
<verse eID="Mark.14.45" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.46" osisID="Mark.14.46" n="46" />And they laid their hands on him and took him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.46" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.47" osisID="Mark.14.47" n="47" />And one of those who were standing by, drew a sword, and struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.
<verse eID="Mark.14.47" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.48" osisID="Mark.14.48" n="48" />And Jesus answering, said to them: Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me?
<verse eID="Mark.14.48" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.49" osisID="Mark.14.49" n="49" />I was daily with you in the temple, and taught, and you did not take me; but <transChange type="added">this is so,</transChange> that the scriptures may be fulfilled.
<verse eID="Mark.14.49" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.50" osisID="Mark.14.50" n="50" />And they all forsook him and fled.
<verse eID="Mark.14.50" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.51" osisID="Mark.14.51" n="51" />And there followed him a certain young man, who had a linen garment around his naked body. And the young men laid hold of him;
<verse eID="Mark.14.51" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.52" osisID="Mark.14.52" n="52" />and he left the linen garment, and fled from them naked.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.52" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.53" osisID="Mark.14.53" n="53" />And they led Jesus away to the chief priest; and with him were assembled all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes.
<verse eID="Mark.14.53" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.54" osisID="Mark.14.54" n="54" />And Peter followed him, at a distance, even into the palace of the chief priest, and sat with the attendants, and warmed himself at the fire.
<verse eID="Mark.14.54" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.55" osisID="Mark.14.55" n="55" />And the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin sought for testimony against Jesus, in order to put him to death, and found none.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.55" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.56" osisID="Mark.14.56" n="56" />For many testified falsely against him, and their testimony did not agree.
<verse eID="Mark.14.56" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.57" osisID="Mark.14.57" n="57" />And some rose up, and testified falsely against him, saying:
<verse eID="Mark.14.57" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.58" osisID="Mark.14.58" n="58" />We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.
<verse eID="Mark.14.58" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.59" osisID="Mark.14.59" n="59" />And not even in this did their testimony agree.
<verse eID="Mark.14.59" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.60" osisID="Mark.14.60" n="60" />And the chief priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying: Do you make no answer? What do these testify against you?
<verse eID="Mark.14.60" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.61" osisID="Mark.14.61" n="61" />But he was silent, and made no answer.
</p>
<p>
Again, the chief priest asked him, and said to him: Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
<verse eID="Mark.14.61" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.62" osisID="Mark.14.62" n="62" />Jesus replied: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
<verse eID="Mark.14.62" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.63" osisID="Mark.14.63" n="63" />And the chief priest rent his clothes, and said: What further need have we of witnesses?
<verse eID="Mark.14.63" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.64" osisID="Mark.14.64" n="64" />You have heard his impious speech. What think you? They all condemned him to be a subject of death.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.64" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.65" osisID="Mark.14.65" n="65" />And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him with their fists, and to say to him: Give a response. And the attendants struck him with their open hands.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.14.65" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.66" osisID="Mark.14.66" n="66" />And while Peter was in the court below, one of the maidservants of the chief priest came;
<verse eID="Mark.14.66" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.67" osisID="Mark.14.67" n="67" />and when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said: You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.
<verse eID="Mark.14.67" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.68" osisID="Mark.14.68" n="68" />But he denied, saying: I neither know, nor understand what you say. And he went out into the entrance, and the cock crew.
<verse eID="Mark.14.68" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.69" osisID="Mark.14.69" n="69" />And the maid-servant saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by: This man is one of them.
<verse eID="Mark.14.69" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.70" osisID="Mark.14.70" n="70" />He again denied. And again, after a little while, those who stood by said to Peter: Surely, you are one of them; for you are a Galilean, and your speech is like theirs.
<verse eID="Mark.14.70" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.71" osisID="Mark.14.71" n="71" />But he began to curse and to swear, saying: I know not this man of whom you speak.
<verse eID="Mark.14.71" />
<verse sID="Mark.14.72" osisID="Mark.14.72" n="72" />And immediately the cock crew the second time. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken to him: Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times. And when he thought upon it, he wept.

<verse eID="Mark.15.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.2" osisID="Mark.15.2" n="2" />And Pilate asked him: Are you the King of the Jews? And he answering, said: You say it.
<verse eID="Mark.15.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.3" osisID="Mark.15.3" n="3" />And the chief priests accused him of many things.
<verse eID="Mark.15.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.4" osisID="Mark.15.4" n="4" />Pilate again asked him, saying: Do you make no answer? See, how many things they testify against you.
<verse eID="Mark.15.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.5" osisID="Mark.15.5" n="5" />But Jesus gave no further answer; so that Pilate was astonished.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.15.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.6" osisID="Mark.15.6" n="6" />Now it was his custom to release to them, at the feast, one prisoner, whomever they desired.
<verse eID="Mark.15.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.7" osisID="Mark.15.7" n="7" />And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with his fellow-insurgents, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
<verse eID="Mark.15.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.8" osisID="Mark.15.8" n="8" />And the multitude cried out, and began to ask him to do as he had always done for them.

<verse eID="Mark.15.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.10" osisID="Mark.15.10" n="10" />For he knew that, through envy, the chief priests had delivered him up.
<verse eID="Mark.15.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.11" osisID="Mark.15.11" n="11" />But the chief priests instigated the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
<verse eID="Mark.15.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.12" osisID="Mark.15.12" n="12" />And Pilate answered and said again to them: What, then, do you wish me to do with him whom you call the King of the Jews?
<verse eID="Mark.15.12" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.13" osisID="Mark.15.13" n="13" />They again cried out: Crucify him.

<verse sID="Mark.15.43" osisID="Mark.15.43" n="43" />Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor, who was himself looking for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
<verse eID="Mark.15.43" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.44" osisID="Mark.15.44" n="44" />But Pilate was astonished that he was already dead; and having called the centurion to him, he inquired of him whether he had been any while dead.
<verse eID="Mark.15.44" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.45" osisID="Mark.15.45" n="45" />And having learned the fact from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
<verse eID="Mark.15.45" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.46" osisID="Mark.15.46" n="46" />And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher that had been hewed out of a rock: and he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.
<verse eID="Mark.15.46" />
<verse sID="Mark.15.47" osisID="Mark.15.47" n="47" />And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

<verse sID="Mark.16.1" osisID="Mark.16.1" n="1" />And when the sabbath had passed, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
<verse eID="Mark.16.1" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.2" osisID="Mark.16.2" n="2" />And very early, on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they came to the sepulcher.
<verse eID="Mark.16.2" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.3" osisID="Mark.16.3" n="3" />And they said among themselves: Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the sepulcher?
<verse eID="Mark.16.3" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.4" osisID="Mark.16.4" n="4" />for it was very great. And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away.
<verse eID="Mark.16.4" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.5" osisID="Mark.16.5" n="5" />And they entered the sepulcher, and saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe: and they were frightened.
<verse eID="Mark.16.5" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.6" osisID="Mark.16.6" n="6" />But he said to them: Be not frightened; you seek Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here: see the place where they laid him.
<verse eID="Mark.16.6" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.7" osisID="Mark.16.7" n="7" />But go, tell his disciples, and Peter, that he goes before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you.
<verse eID="Mark.16.7" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.8" osisID="Mark.16.8" n="8" />And they went out, and fled from the sepulcher; for trembling and astonishment seized upon them. And they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.

<p>
<verse eID="Mark.16.8" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.9" osisID="Mark.16.9" n="9" />Now when Jesus had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.
<verse eID="Mark.16.9" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.10" osisID="Mark.16.10" n="10" />And she went and told it to those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
<verse eID="Mark.16.10" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.11" osisID="Mark.16.11" n="11" />And though they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they did not believe.

<p>
<verse eID="Mark.16.11" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.12" osisID="Mark.16.12" n="12" />After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they walked and went into the country.

<verse sID="Mark.16.14" osisID="Mark.16.14" n="14" />Afterward he appeared to the eleven as they reclined at table; and he reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Mark.16.14" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.15" osisID="Mark.16.15" n="15" />And he said to them: Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
<verse eID="Mark.16.15" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.16" osisID="Mark.16.16" n="16" />He that believes and is immersed, shall be saved; he that believes not, shall be condemned.
<verse eID="Mark.16.16" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.17" osisID="Mark.16.17" n="17" />And these signs shall attend those who believe. In my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;
<verse eID="Mark.16.17" />
<verse sID="Mark.16.18" osisID="Mark.16.18" n="18" />they shall take up serpents; and, if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.

<verse sID="Luke.1.1" osisID="Luke.1.1" n="1" />Since many have undertaken to compose a history of the things that are fully believed among us,
<verse eID="Luke.1.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.2" osisID="Luke.1.2" n="2" />even as they were delivered to us by those who were, from the beginning, eye-witnesses and ministers of the word;
<verse eID="Luke.1.2" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.3" osisID="Luke.1.3" n="3" />it seemed good to me also, having obtained exact information of all things from the very first, to write them in order for you, most excellent Theophilus,
<verse eID="Luke.1.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.4" osisID="Luke.1.4" n="4" />that you might know the certainty of the things in which you have been instructed.
</p>
<p>

<verse sID="Luke.1.5" osisID="Luke.1.5" n="5" />There was, in the days of Herod the king of Judea, a certain priest, named Zachariah, of the class of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
<verse eID="Luke.1.5" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.6" osisID="Luke.1.6" n="6" />They were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.
<verse eID="Luke.1.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.7" osisID="Luke.1.7" n="7" />And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.8" osisID="Luke.1.8" n="8" />It came to pass, while he was officiating as priest before God, in the order of his class, that,
<verse eID="Luke.1.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.9" osisID="Luke.1.9" n="9" />according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense, when he went into the temple of the Lord.
<verse eID="Luke.1.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.10" osisID="Luke.1.10" n="10" />And all the multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.
<verse eID="Luke.1.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.11" osisID="Luke.1.11" n="11" />And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.11" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.12" osisID="Luke.1.12" n="12" />And Zachariah was troubled at the sight, and fear fell upon him.
<verse eID="Luke.1.12" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.13" osisID="Luke.1.13" n="13" />But the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachariah; for your prayer is heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
<verse eID="Luke.1.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.14" osisID="Luke.1.14" n="14" />And you shall have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth.
<verse eID="Luke.1.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.15" osisID="Luke.1.15" n="15" />For he shall be great before the Lord; and he shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.
<verse eID="Luke.1.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.16" osisID="Luke.1.16" n="16" />And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
<verse eID="Luke.1.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.17" osisID="Luke.1.17" n="17" />And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient, by the wisdom of the just, in order to make ready for the Lord a prepared people.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.17" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.18" osisID="Luke.1.18" n="18" />And Zachariah said to the angel: By what <transChange type="added">sign</transChange> shall I know this? for I am old, and my wife is advanced in years.
<verse eID="Luke.1.18" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.19" osisID="Luke.1.19" n="19" />And the angel answered and said to him: I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and I am sent to speak to you, and to announce to you this good news.
<verse eID="Luke.1.19" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.20" osisID="Luke.1.20" n="20" />And behold, you shall be dumb and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall take place, because you did not believe my words, which shall be fulfilled in their proper time.
<verse eID="Luke.1.20" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.21" osisID="Luke.1.21" n="21" />And the people were waiting for Zachariah, and they wondered that he stayed so long in the temple.
<verse eID="Luke.1.21" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.22" osisID="Luke.1.22" n="22" />But when he came out, he was not able to speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he made signs to them, and remained speechless.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.23" osisID="Luke.1.23" n="23" />And it came to pass, when the days of his service were completed, that he departed to his own house.
<verse eID="Luke.1.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.24" osisID="Luke.1.24" n="24" />And after those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and kept herself retired for five months, saying:
<verse eID="Luke.1.24" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.25" osisID="Luke.1.25" n="25" />Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days in which he has looked with regard upon me, to take away my reproach among men.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.25" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.26" osisID="Luke.1.26" n="26" />And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
<verse eID="Luke.1.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.27" osisID="Luke.1.27" n="27" />to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.28" osisID="Luke.1.28" n="28" />And the angel came into her presence, and said: Hail, graciously accepted: the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women.
<verse eID="Luke.1.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.29" osisID="Luke.1.29" n="29" />And she was perplexed at his words, and reasoned, what this salutation could mean.
<verse eID="Luke.1.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.30" osisID="Luke.1.30" n="30" />And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary; for you have found favor with God.
<verse eID="Luke.1.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.31" osisID="Luke.1.31" n="31" />And behold, you shall conceive and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
<verse eID="Luke.1.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.32" osisID="Luke.1.32" n="32" />He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of David his father;
<verse eID="Luke.1.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.33" osisID="Luke.1.33" n="33" />and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.34" osisID="Luke.1.34" n="34" />But Mary said to the angel: How shall this be, since I know not a man?
<verse eID="Luke.1.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.35" osisID="Luke.1.35" n="35" />And the angel answered and said to her: The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; for which reason, also, that which is begotten, being holy, shall be called the Son of God.
<verse eID="Luke.1.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.36" osisID="Luke.1.36" n="36" />And behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman, even she has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who is called barren;
<verse eID="Luke.1.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.37" osisID="Luke.1.37" n="37" />for nothing shall be impossible with God.
<verse eID="Luke.1.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.38" osisID="Luke.1.38" n="38" />And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.38" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.39" osisID="Luke.1.39" n="39" />And Mary arose in those days, and went with haste into the mountainous country, into a city of Judah;
<verse eID="Luke.1.39" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.40" osisID="Luke.1.40" n="40" />and she came into the house of Zachariah, and saluted Elizabeth.
<verse eID="Luke.1.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.41" osisID="Luke.1.41" n="41" />And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, that the babe in her womb leaped for joy.
<verse eID="Luke.1.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.42" osisID="Luke.1.42" n="42" />And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke with a loud voice, and said: Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.
<verse eID="Luke.1.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.43" osisID="Luke.1.43" n="43" />And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
<verse eID="Luke.1.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.44" osisID="Luke.1.44" n="44" />For, behold, when the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy.
<verse eID="Luke.1.44" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.45" osisID="Luke.1.45" n="45" />And blessed is she who believed; for there shall be a fulfillment of the things which were spoken to her from the Lord.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.45" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.46" osisID="Luke.1.46" n="46" />And Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord,
<verse eID="Luke.1.46" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.47" osisID="Luke.1.47" n="47" />and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior;
<verse eID="Luke.1.47" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.48" osisID="Luke.1.48" n="48" />for he has looked upon the lowly condition of his handmaid. For, behold, from this time, all generations shall call me blessed;
<verse eID="Luke.1.48" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.49" osisID="Luke.1.49" n="49" />for He that is Mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name:
<verse eID="Luke.1.49" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.50" osisID="Luke.1.50" n="50" />and his mercy is from generation to generation upon those who fear him.
<verse eID="Luke.1.50" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.51" osisID="Luke.1.51" n="51" />He has done mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their hearts.
<verse eID="Luke.1.51" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.52" osisID="Luke.1.52" n="52" />He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the lowly.
<verse eID="Luke.1.52" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.53" osisID="Luke.1.53" n="53" />He has filled the hungry with good things, but the rich he has sent empty away.
<verse eID="Luke.1.53" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.54" osisID="Luke.1.54" n="54" />He has helped Israel his servant, (as he spoke to our fathers,)
<verse eID="Luke.1.54" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.55" osisID="Luke.1.55" n="55" />by remembering his mercy to Abraham and to his posterity forever.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.55" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.56" osisID="Luke.1.56" n="56" />And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.56" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.57" osisID="Luke.1.57" n="57" />Now the time for Elizabeth to be delivered had fully come; and she gave birth to a son.
<verse eID="Luke.1.57" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.58" osisID="Luke.1.58" n="58" />And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had showed great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.58" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.59" osisID="Luke.1.59" n="59" />And it came to pass, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they called him by the name of his father, Zachariah.
<verse eID="Luke.1.59" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.60" osisID="Luke.1.60" n="60" />And his mother answered and said: Not so: but he shall be called John.
<verse eID="Luke.1.60" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.61" osisID="Luke.1.61" n="61" />And they said to her: There is no one among your relatives that is called by this name.
<verse eID="Luke.1.61" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.62" osisID="Luke.1.62" n="62" />And they made signs to his father, to know what he wished him to be called.
<verse eID="Luke.1.62" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.63" osisID="Luke.1.63" n="63" />And having asked for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying: His name is John. And they were all astonished.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.63" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.64" osisID="Luke.1.64" n="64" />And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue was loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.
<verse eID="Luke.1.64" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.65" osisID="Luke.1.65" n="65" />And fear came on all that dwelt round about them; and all these things were talked of everywhere throughout the mountainous country of Judea.
<verse eID="Luke.1.65" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.66" osisID="Luke.1.66" n="66" />And all that heard them, laid them up in their hearts, and said: What, then, will this child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.1.66" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.67" osisID="Luke.1.67" n="67" />And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:
<verse eID="Luke.1.67" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.68" osisID="Luke.1.68" n="68" />Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people;
<verse eID="Luke.1.68" />
<verse sID="Luke.1.69" osisID="Luke.1.69" n="69" />and he has raised up for us, in the house of David his servant, a horn of salvation,

<verse sID="Luke.4.22" osisID="Luke.4.22" n="22" />And all extolled him; and they wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth, and said: Is not this the son of Joseph?
<verse eID="Luke.4.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.23" osisID="Luke.4.23" n="23" />And he said to them: You will assuredly apply to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself. Whatever things we have heard were done in Capernaum, do also here in your country.
<verse eID="Luke.4.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.24" osisID="Luke.4.24" n="24" />And he said: Verily I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.
<verse eID="Luke.4.24" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.25" osisID="Luke.4.25" n="25" />And I tell you, in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months, so that a great famine was on all the land:
<verse eID="Luke.4.25" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.26" osisID="Luke.4.26" n="26" />and to no one of them was Elijah sent, but to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow.
<verse eID="Luke.4.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.27" osisID="Luke.4.27" n="27" />And many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Elisha the prophet; and no one of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.

<verse eID="Luke.4.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.28" osisID="Luke.4.28" n="28" />And all that were in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with anger,
<verse eID="Luke.4.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.29" osisID="Luke.4.29" n="29" />and arose, and drove him out of the city, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.
<verse eID="Luke.4.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.30" osisID="Luke.4.30" n="30" />But he passed through the midst of them, and went away.

<verse eID="Luke.4.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.31" osisID="Luke.4.31" n="31" />And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath-days.
<verse eID="Luke.4.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.32" osisID="Luke.4.32" n="32" />And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.
<verse eID="Luke.4.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.33" osisID="Luke.4.33" n="33" />And there was in the synagogue a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice,
<verse eID="Luke.4.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.34" osisID="Luke.4.34" n="34" />saying: Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Nazarene? Hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
<verse eID="Luke.4.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.35" osisID="Luke.4.35" n="35" />And Jesus rebuked him, saying: Be silent, and come out of him. And the demon threw him into the midst, and came out of him, and hurt him not.
<verse eID="Luke.4.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.36" osisID="Luke.4.36" n="36" />And amazement came upon all, and they spoke one to another, saying: What teaching is this? for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.

<verse sID="Luke.4.38" osisID="Luke.4.38" n="38" />And he arose and went out of the synagogue into the house of Simon. And Simon’s mother-in-law was confined with a violent fever: and they besought him in her behalf.
<verse eID="Luke.4.38" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.39" osisID="Luke.4.39" n="39" />And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever, and it left her: and she arose immediately, and ministered to them.

<verse eID="Luke.4.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.41" osisID="Luke.4.41" n="41" />Demons also came out of many, crying out and saying: Thou art the Christ, the Son of God. And he rebuked them, and did not permit them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.

<verse eID="Luke.4.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.4.43" osisID="Luke.4.43" n="43" />But he said to them: I must make known the good news of the kingdom of God to other cities also; for to this end I have been sent.

<verse sID="Luke.6.43" osisID="Luke.6.43" n="43" />For a good tree does not produce unsound fruit; nor does an unsound tree produce good fruit.
<verse eID="Luke.6.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.44" osisID="Luke.6.44" n="44" />For every tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes gathered from brambles.
<verse eID="Luke.6.44" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.45" osisID="Luke.6.45" n="45" />The good man, out of the good treasury of his heart, brings forth that which is good; and the evil man, out of the evil treasury of his heart, brings forth that which is evil. For out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks.

<verse sID="Luke.6.47" osisID="Luke.6.47" n="47" />Every one that comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.
<verse eID="Luke.6.47" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.48" osisID="Luke.6.48" n="48" />He is like a man that, when building a house, digged deep, and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the torrent dashed against that house, and it was not able to shake it, for it was founded on the rock.
<verse eID="Luke.6.48" />
<verse sID="Luke.6.49" osisID="Luke.6.49" n="49" />But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth, without a foundation, against which the torrent dashed with violence, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.

<verse eID="Luke.7.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.2" osisID="Luke.7.2" n="2" />And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick, and about to die.
<verse eID="Luke.7.2" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.3" osisID="Luke.7.3" n="3" />But when he heard of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, and besought him to come and save his servant.
<verse eID="Luke.7.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.4" osisID="Luke.7.4" n="4" />And they came to Jesus, and besought him earnestly, saying: He is worthy for whom thou shouldst do this;
<verse eID="Luke.7.4" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.5" osisID="Luke.7.5" n="5" />for he loves our nation, and of his own accord has built us a synagogue.
<verse eID="Luke.7.5" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.6" osisID="Luke.7.6" n="6" />And Jesus went with them.
</p>
<p>
And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, and said to him: Lord, give thyself no trouble; for I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof.
<verse eID="Luke.7.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.7" osisID="Luke.7.7" n="7" />For which reason, neither did I count myself worthy to go to thee; but command in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
<verse eID="Luke.7.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.8" osisID="Luke.7.8" n="8" />For I am a man placed under authority, and have soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.

<verse eID="Luke.7.20" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.21" osisID="Luke.7.21" n="21" />And in that very hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and bestowed sight on many that were blind.
<verse eID="Luke.7.21" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.22" osisID="Luke.7.22" n="22" />And Jesus answered and said to them: Go and tell John what you have seen and heard; that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them;
<verse eID="Luke.7.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.23" osisID="Luke.7.23" n="23" />and blessed is he who shall find no cause of offense in me.

<verse sID="Luke.7.27" osisID="Luke.7.27" n="27" />This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.

<verse sID="Luke.7.37" osisID="Luke.7.37" n="37" />And, behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that he reclined at table in the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
<verse eID="Luke.7.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.38" osisID="Luke.7.38" n="38" />and stood behind at his feet, weeping; and she began to wash his feet with her tears; and she wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.
<verse eID="Luke.7.38" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.39" osisID="Luke.7.39" n="39" />But when the Pharisee who had invited him, saw it, he said within himself: This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who, and what sort of woman this is that touches him; for she is a sinner.

<verse eID="Luke.7.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.7.43" osisID="Luke.7.43" n="43" />Simon answered and said: I suppose he to whom he forgave the more. He said to him: You have decided correctly.

<verse sID="Luke.7.45" osisID="Luke.7.45" n="45" />You gave me no kiss; but she, from the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.

<verse sID="Luke.7.47" osisID="Luke.7.47" n="47" />Wherefore, I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much. But he to whom little is forgiven, loves little.

<verse eID="Luke.8.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.2" osisID="Luke.8.2" n="2" />and also certain women that had been cured of evil spirits and diseases; Mary, called Magdalene, out of whom had gone seven demons,

<verse eID="Luke.8.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.4" osisID="Luke.8.4" n="4" />And when a great multitude had assembled, and they were coming to him from every city, he spoke by a parable:
<verse eID="Luke.8.4" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.5" osisID="Luke.8.5" n="5" />The sower went forth to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell by the wayside, and it was trodden down, and the birds of the air ate it up.
<verse eID="Luke.8.5" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.6" osisID="Luke.8.6" n="6" />And some fell upon the rock; and when it had sprung up, it withered, because it had no moisture.
<verse eID="Luke.8.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.7" osisID="Luke.8.7" n="7" />And some fell in the midst of thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.
<verse eID="Luke.8.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.8" osisID="Luke.8.8" n="8" />And other seed fell into good ground, and sprung up, and produced fruit a hundred-fold. When he had said these things, he cried: He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.8.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.9" osisID="Luke.8.9" n="9" />And the disciples asked him, saying: What does this parable mean?
<verse eID="Luke.8.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.10" osisID="Luke.8.10" n="10" />He replied: To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that when they see, they may not see, and when they hear, they may not understand.
<verse eID="Luke.8.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.11" osisID="Luke.8.11" n="11" />But the meaning of the parable is this: The seed is the word of God;
<verse eID="Luke.8.11" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.12" osisID="Luke.8.12" n="12" />those by the wayside are they that hear; then comes the devil and takes the word from their heart, lest they should believe and be saved.
<verse eID="Luke.8.12" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.13" osisID="Luke.8.13" n="13" />Those on the rock are they that, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who, for awhile, believe, and in time of temptation apostatize.
<verse eID="Luke.8.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.14" osisID="Luke.8.14" n="14" />That which fell among thorns are those who hear, and so conduct themselves, that they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
<verse eID="Luke.8.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.15" osisID="Luke.8.15" n="15" />But that on the good ground are those who, in a good and honest heart, hear the word, and keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.

<verse eID="Luke.8.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.16" osisID="Luke.8.16" n="16" />No one when he has lighted a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a divan, but sets it on a lamp-stand, that they who come in may see the light.
<verse eID="Luke.8.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.17" osisID="Luke.8.17" n="17" />For there is nothing concealed, that shall not be made manifest, nor hid, that shall not be known and brought into view.

<verse sID="Luke.8.28" osisID="Luke.8.28" n="28" />When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I beseech thee, torment me not.
<verse eID="Luke.8.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.29" osisID="Luke.8.29" n="29" />For he had O; commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized upon him, and he had been bound with chains and fetters, and kept in confinement; and he broke the bonds, and was driven by the demon into the deserts.
<verse eID="Luke.8.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.30" osisID="Luke.8.30" n="30" />And Jesus asked him, saying: What is your name? He answered, Legion; for many demons had entered into him.

<verse eID="Luke.8.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.36" osisID="Luke.8.36" n="36" />And those who had seen it, told them by what means the man who had been possessed with the demons, was saved.

<verse sID="Luke.8.46" osisID="Luke.8.46" n="46" />But Jesus said: Some one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me.
<verse eID="Luke.8.46" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.47" osisID="Luke.8.47" n="47" />And the woman, seeing that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and fell down before him, and told him, before all the people, for what cause she had touched him, and that she was immediately restored to health.
<verse eID="Luke.8.47" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.48" osisID="Luke.8.48" n="48" />And he said to her: Take courage, daughter; your faith has saved you; go in peace.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.8.48" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.49" osisID="Luke.8.49" n="49" />While he was yet speaking, there came some one from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and said to him: Your daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.
<verse eID="Luke.8.49" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.50" osisID="Luke.8.50" n="50" />But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying: Fear not, only believe, and she shall be saved.
<verse eID="Luke.8.50" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.51" osisID="Luke.8.51" n="51" />And when he came to the house, he permitted no one to go in but Peter and James and John, and the father and the mother of the child.
<verse eID="Luke.8.51" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.52" osisID="Luke.8.52" n="52" />And all were weeping and lamenting her. But he said: Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps.
<verse eID="Luke.8.52" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.53" osisID="Luke.8.53" n="53" />And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.
<verse eID="Luke.8.53" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.54" osisID="Luke.8.54" n="54" />But he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, and said: Child, arise.
<verse eID="Luke.8.54" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.55" osisID="Luke.8.55" n="55" />And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And he commanded that food should be given her.
<verse eID="Luke.8.55" />
<verse sID="Luke.8.56" osisID="Luke.8.56" n="56" />And her parents were amazed. But he charged them to tell no one what had been done.

<chapter sID="Luke.9" osisID="Luke.9" n="9" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.1" osisID="Luke.9.1" n="1" />And he called his twelve disciples to him, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases:
<verse eID="Luke.9.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.2" osisID="Luke.9.2" n="2" />and he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
<verse eID="Luke.9.2" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.3" osisID="Luke.9.3" n="3" />And he said to them: Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; nor have two coats each.
<verse eID="Luke.9.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.4" osisID="Luke.9.4" n="4" />And whatever house you enter, there remain, and thence depart.
<verse eID="Luke.9.4" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.5" osisID="Luke.9.5" n="5" />And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off even the dust from your feet, for a testimony against them.
<verse eID="Luke.9.5" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.6" osisID="Luke.9.6" n="6" />And they departed, and went through every village, preaching the gospel, and performing cures everywhere.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.7" osisID="Luke.9.7" n="7" />And Herod the tetrarch heard of all things that were done by him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some, that John had risen from the dead;
<verse eID="Luke.9.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.8" osisID="Luke.9.8" n="8" />and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that a prophet of ancient times had risen again.
<verse eID="Luke.9.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.9" osisID="Luke.9.9" n="9" />And Herod said: John I have beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.10" osisID="Luke.9.10" n="10" />And the apostles returned, and told him all that they had done. And he took them, and withdrew privately to a desert place, that belonged to a city called Bethsaida.
<verse eID="Luke.9.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.11" osisID="Luke.9.11" n="11" />But the multitudes knew it, and followed him; and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.11" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.12" osisID="Luke.9.12" n="12" />And the day began to decline; and the twelve came and said to him: Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and the country round about, and lodge, and find food; for we are here in a desert place.
<verse eID="Luke.9.12" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.13" osisID="Luke.9.13" n="13" />But he said to them: Do you give them food. They replied: We have nothing but five loaves and two fishes, unless we go and buy food for all these people.
<verse eID="Luke.9.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.14" osisID="Luke.9.14" n="14" />For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples: Make them recline in companies of fifty.
<verse eID="Luke.9.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.15" osisID="Luke.9.15" n="15" />And they did so, and made them all recline.
<verse eID="Luke.9.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.16" osisID="Luke.9.16" n="16" />And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke, and gave them to the disciples, to set before the multitude.
<verse eID="Luke.9.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.17" osisID="Luke.9.17" n="17" />And they all ate, and were satisfied; and there was taken up what remained to them of the broken pieces, twelve baskets.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.17" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.18" osisID="Luke.9.18" n="18" />And it came to pass, as he was praying in a retired place, that his disciples were with him; and he asked them, saying: Who do the multitudes say that I am?
<verse eID="Luke.9.18" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.19" osisID="Luke.9.19" n="19" />They answered and said: John the Immerser; but some, Elijah; and others, that some prophet of ancient times has risen again.
<verse eID="Luke.9.19" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.20" osisID="Luke.9.20" n="20" />He said to them: But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said: The Christ of God.
<verse eID="Luke.9.20" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.21" osisID="Luke.9.21" n="21" />And he strictly charged them and commanded them to tell this to no one,
<verse eID="Luke.9.21" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.22" osisID="Luke.9.22" n="22" />saying: The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be put to death, and be raised the third day.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.23" osisID="Luke.9.23" n="23" />And he said to them all: If any one determines to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
<verse eID="Luke.9.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.24" osisID="Luke.9.24" n="24" />For whoever will save his life, shall lose it; but whoever will lose his life for my sake, shall save it.
<verse eID="Luke.9.24" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.25" osisID="Luke.9.25" n="25" />For what will it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and destroy himself, or be lost?
<verse eID="Luke.9.25" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.26" osisID="Luke.9.26" n="26" />For whoever will be ashamed of me and my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in his own glory; and that of the Father, and of the holy angels.
<verse eID="Luke.9.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.27" osisID="Luke.9.27" n="27" />But I say to you, of a truth, there are some of these who stand here that shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.28" osisID="Luke.9.28" n="28" />And it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
<verse eID="Luke.9.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.29" osisID="Luke.9.29" n="29" />And as he prayed, the appearance of his face was changed, and his raiment became white and glittering.
<verse eID="Luke.9.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.30" osisID="Luke.9.30" n="30" />And, behold, two men conversed with him, who were Moses and Elijah;
<verse eID="Luke.9.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.31" osisID="Luke.9.31" n="31" />they appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.32" osisID="Luke.9.32" n="32" />And Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep; but having fully awakened, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
<verse eID="Luke.9.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.33" osisID="Luke.9.33" n="33" />And it came to pass, that, as they were withdrawing from him, Peter said to Jesus: Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for. Elijah, not knowing what he said.
<verse eID="Luke.9.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.34" osisID="Luke.9.34" n="34" />While he was saying these things, there came a cloud, and it overshadowed them; and they were afraid as those men entered the cloud.
<verse eID="Luke.9.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.35" osisID="Luke.9.35" n="35" />And there came a voice from the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son; hear him.
<verse eID="Luke.9.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.36" osisID="Luke.9.36" n="36" />And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it secret, and told no one, in those days, any of the things which they had seen.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.37" osisID="Luke.9.37" n="37" />And it came to pass, that, on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
<verse eID="Luke.9.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.38" osisID="Luke.9.38" n="38" />And, behold, a man from the multitude cried out, saying: Teacher, I beseech thee, look upon my son, for he is my only child;
<verse eID="Luke.9.38" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.39" osisID="Luke.9.39" n="39" />and, behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it throws him into convulsions, and causes him to foam, and after depriving him of strength, hardly departs from him.
<verse eID="Luke.9.39" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.40" osisID="Luke.9.40" n="40" />And I entreated thy disciples to cast it out; but they were not able.
<verse eID="Luke.9.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.41" osisID="Luke.9.41" n="41" />And Jesus answering, said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you! Bring your son hither.
<verse eID="Luke.9.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.42" osisID="Luke.9.42" n="42" />And while he was coming, the demon cast him to the ground, and threw him into convulsions; but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and restored the child to health, and gave him back to his father.
<verse eID="Luke.9.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.43" osisID="Luke.9.43" n="43" />And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God.
</p>
<p>
And while they were all wondering at every thing that Jesus did, he said to his disciples:
<verse eID="Luke.9.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.44" osisID="Luke.9.44" n="44" />Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.
<verse eID="Luke.9.44" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.45" osisID="Luke.9.45" n="45" />But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they might not understand it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.45" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.46" osisID="Luke.9.46" n="46" />And there arose a contention among them, which of them should be greatest.
<verse eID="Luke.9.46" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.47" osisID="Luke.9.47" n="47" />But Jesus perceived the thought of their heart, and he took a little child, and made it stand by him,
<verse eID="Luke.9.47" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.48" osisID="Luke.9.48" n="48" />and said to them: Whoever will receive this little child on my account, receives me; and whoever will receive me, receives him that sent me. For he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.48" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.49" osisID="Luke.9.49" n="49" />And John answered and said: Master, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.
<verse eID="Luke.9.49" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.50" osisID="Luke.9.50" n="50" />And Jesus said to him: Forbid him not; for whoever is not against us, is for us.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.50" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.51" osisID="Luke.9.51" n="51" />And it came to pass, as the time for him to be taken up into heaven had fully come, that he set his face steadfastly to go up to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Luke.9.51" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.52" osisID="Luke.9.52" n="52" />And he sent messengers before his face; and they went, and entered a village of the Samaritans, to prepare for him.
<verse eID="Luke.9.52" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.53" osisID="Luke.9.53" n="53" />And they did not receive him, because his face was turned toward Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Luke.9.53" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.54" osisID="Luke.9.54" n="54" />And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said: Lord, is it thy will that we command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them, even as Elijah did?
<verse eID="Luke.9.54" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.55" osisID="Luke.9.55" n="55" />But he turned and rebuked them, and said: You know not of what spirit you are.
<verse eID="Luke.9.55" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.56" osisID="Luke.9.56" n="56" />And they went to another village.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.9.56" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.57" osisID="Luke.9.57" n="57" />And it came to pass, as they were going on their journey, that a certain man said to him: Lord, I will follow thee wherever thou shalt go.
<verse eID="Luke.9.57" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.58" osisID="Luke.9.58" n="58" />And Jesus said to him: The foxes have dens, and the birds of the air have roosts, but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.
<verse eID="Luke.9.58" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.59" osisID="Luke.9.59" n="59" />And he said to another: Follow me. But he replied: Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.
<verse eID="Luke.9.59" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.60" osisID="Luke.9.60" n="60" />Jesus said: Let the dead bury their own dead; but do you go and publish abroad the kingdom of God.
<verse eID="Luke.9.60" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.61" osisID="Luke.9.61" n="61" />And another said: I will follow thee, Lord; but first permit me to take leave of those at home.
<verse eID="Luke.9.61" />
<verse sID="Luke.9.62" osisID="Luke.9.62" n="62" />Jesus said to him: No one that puts his hand to the plow, and looks back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

<verse eID="Luke.10.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.10.2" osisID="Luke.10.2" n="2" />He said, therefore, to them: The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest that he send out laborers into his harvest.
<verse eID="Luke.10.2" />
<verse sID="Luke.10.3" osisID="Luke.10.3" n="3" />Go; behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.

<verse sID="Luke.10.14" osisID="Luke.10.14" n="14" />But for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment, than for you.

<verse sID="Luke.10.21" osisID="Luke.10.21" n="21" />In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said: I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes; even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.

<verse sID="Luke.18.9" osisID="Luke.18.9" n="9" />And he spoke this parable to some, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and who despised others.
<verse eID="Luke.18.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.10" osisID="Luke.18.10" n="10" />Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
<verse eID="Luke.18.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.11" osisID="Luke.18.11" n="11" />The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
<verse eID="Luke.18.11" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.12" osisID="Luke.18.12" n="12" />I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I possess.
<verse eID="Luke.18.12" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.13" osisID="Luke.18.13" n="13" />And the publican, standing afar off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying: God, be merciful to me a sinner.
<verse eID="Luke.18.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.14" osisID="Luke.18.14" n="14" />I say to you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For every one that exalts himself, shall be humbled; but he that humbles himself, shall be exalted.

<p>
<verse eID="Luke.18.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.15" osisID="Luke.18.15" n="15" />And they brought to him infants also, that he might touch them. But when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
<verse eID="Luke.18.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.16" osisID="Luke.18.16" n="16" />And Jesus called them to him, and said: Let the little children come to me, and hinder them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.
<verse eID="Luke.18.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.17" osisID="Luke.18.17" n="17" />Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God, as a little child, shall in no way enter into it.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.18.17" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.18" osisID="Luke.18.18" n="18" />And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
<verse eID="Luke.18.18" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.19" osisID="Luke.18.19" n="19" />And Jesus said to him: Why do you call me good? None is good but one, <transChange type="added">that is</transChange> God.
<verse eID="Luke.18.19" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.20" osisID="Luke.18.20" n="20" />You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery; Do not kill; Do not steal; Do not bear false testimony; Honor your father and your mother.
<verse eID="Luke.18.20" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.21" osisID="Luke.18.21" n="21" />He replied: All these have I kept from my youth.
<verse eID="Luke.18.21" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.22" osisID="Luke.18.22" n="22" />When Jesus heard this, he said to him: One thing you yet lack; sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
<verse eID="Luke.18.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.23" osisID="Luke.18.23" n="23" />And when he heard this, he was very sad, for he was very rich.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.18.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.24" osisID="Luke.18.24" n="24" />When Jesus saw that he was very sad, he said: How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
<verse eID="Luke.18.24" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.25" osisID="Luke.18.25" n="25" />For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom, of God.
<verse eID="Luke.18.25" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.26" osisID="Luke.18.26" n="26" />And those who heard it said: Who, then, can be saved?
<verse eID="Luke.18.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.27" osisID="Luke.18.27" n="27" />He replied: Things that are impossible with men, are possible with God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.18.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.28" osisID="Luke.18.28" n="28" />Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all and followed thee.
<verse eID="Luke.18.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.29" osisID="Luke.18.29" n="29" />And he said to them: Verily I say to you, There is no one that has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,
<verse eID="Luke.18.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.30" osisID="Luke.18.30" n="30" />who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the age to come, eternal life.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.18.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.31" osisID="Luke.18.31" n="31" />And he took the twelve aside, and said to them: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.:
<verse eID="Luke.18.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.32" osisID="Luke.18.32" n="32" />For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be derided and insulted and spit upon;
<verse eID="Luke.18.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.33" osisID="Luke.18.33" n="33" />and they shall scourge him, and put him to death, and on the third day he shall rise again.
<verse eID="Luke.18.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.34" osisID="Luke.18.34" n="34" />And they understood none of these things; and this saying was concealed from them; and they understood not the things that were spoken.

<p>
<verse eID="Luke.18.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.35" osisID="Luke.18.35" n="35" />And it came to pass, that, as he came near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road begging.
<verse eID="Luke.18.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.36" osisID="Luke.18.36" n="36" />And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.
<verse eID="Luke.18.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.37" osisID="Luke.18.37" n="37" />And they told him that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by.
<verse eID="Luke.18.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.38" osisID="Luke.18.38" n="38" />And he cried out and said: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.
<verse eID="Luke.18.38" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.39" osisID="Luke.18.39" n="39" />And those who went before rebuked him, that he should be silent. But he cried so much the more: Son of David, have mercy on me.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.18.39" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.40" osisID="Luke.18.40" n="40" />And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,
<verse eID="Luke.18.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.41" osisID="Luke.18.41" n="41" />saying: What do you wish me to do for you? he replied: Lord, that I may receive my sight.
<verse eID="Luke.18.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.42" osisID="Luke.18.42" n="42" />And Jesus said to him: Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.
<verse eID="Luke.18.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.18.43" osisID="Luke.18.43" n="43" />And he immediately received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.

<verse eID="Luke.19.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.2" osisID="Luke.19.2" n="2" />And, behold, there was a man called Zacchæus, who was a chief publican; and he was rich.
<verse eID="Luke.19.2" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.3" osisID="Luke.19.3" n="3" />And he sought to see Jesus, who he was, and was not able on account of the multitude, because he was of small stature.
<verse eID="Luke.19.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.4" osisID="Luke.19.4" n="4" />And he ran before, and climbed up a sycamore-tree, that he might see him, for he was about to pass that way.
<verse eID="Luke.19.4" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.5" osisID="Luke.19.5" n="5" />And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him: Zacchæus, make haste and come down, for I must spend this day at your house.
<verse eID="Luke.19.5" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.6" osisID="Luke.19.6" n="6" />And he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.19.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.7" osisID="Luke.19.7" n="7" />And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying: He has gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
<verse eID="Luke.19.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.8" osisID="Luke.19.8" n="8" />And Zacchæus stood, and said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken from any one by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.
<verse eID="Luke.19.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.9" osisID="Luke.19.9" n="9" />And Jesus said to him: To-day has salvation come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.
<verse eID="Luke.19.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.10" osisID="Luke.19.10" n="10" />For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.19.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.11" osisID="Luke.19.11" n="11" />And as they heard these things, he also spoke a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.
<verse eID="Luke.19.11" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.12" osisID="Luke.19.12" n="12" />He said, therefore: A certain nobleman went into a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

</p>
<p>

<verse sID="Luke.19.15" osisID="Luke.19.15" n="15" />And it came to pass, that, when he had returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded those servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know what each had gained by trading.
<verse eID="Luke.19.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.16" osisID="Luke.19.16" n="16" />And the first came and said: Lord, your pound has gained ten pounds.
<verse eID="Luke.19.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.17" osisID="Luke.19.17" n="17" />And he said to him: Well done, good servant; because you have been faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.
<verse eID="Luke.19.17" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.18" osisID="Luke.19.18" n="18" />And the second came and said: Lord, your pound has gained five pounds.

<verse eID="Luke.19.20" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.21" osisID="Luke.19.21" n="21" />For I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man; you take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.19.21" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.22" osisID="Luke.19.22" n="22" />Then he said to him: Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a hard man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow.
<verse eID="Luke.19.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.23" osisID="Luke.19.23" n="23" />And why then did you not put my money into the bank, that, when I came, I could have collected it with interest?
<verse eID="Luke.19.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.24" osisID="Luke.19.24" n="24" />And he said to those who stood by: Take from him the pound, and give it to him that has ten pounds.

<verse sID="Luke.19.27" osisID="Luke.19.27" n="27" />But those who are my enemies, who were not willing that I should rule over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.
<verse eID="Luke.19.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.28" osisID="Luke.19.28" n="28" />And when he had said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.19.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.29" osisID="Luke.19.29" n="29" />And it came to pass, that, when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
<verse eID="Luke.19.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.30" osisID="Luke.19.30" n="30" />saying: Go into the opposite village, in which, when you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever sat. Loose him, and bring him.
<verse eID="Luke.19.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.31" osisID="Luke.19.31" n="31" />And if any one ask you why you loose him, thus shall you say to him: The Lord has need of him.

<p>
<verse eID="Luke.19.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.32" osisID="Luke.19.32" n="32" />And those who were sent, went, and found as he had said to them.
<verse eID="Luke.19.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.33" osisID="Luke.19.33" n="33" />And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of him said to them: Why do you loose the colt?
<verse eID="Luke.19.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.34" osisID="Luke.19.34" n="34" />They replied: The Lord has need of him.
<verse eID="Luke.19.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.35" osisID="Luke.19.35" n="35" />And they brought him to Jesus, and threw their mantles upon the colt, and set Jesus on him.
<verse eID="Luke.19.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.36" osisID="Luke.19.36" n="36" />And as he was going on, they spread their mantles in the road.

<verse sID="Luke.19.37" osisID="Luke.19.37" n="37" />And when he was now near the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God, with a loud voice, for all the mighty deeds which they had seen,
<verse eID="Luke.19.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.38" osisID="Luke.19.38" n="38" />saying: Blessed is the king that comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
<verse eID="Luke.19.38" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.39" osisID="Luke.19.39" n="39" />And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude, said to him: Teacher, rebuke your disciples.
<verse eID="Luke.19.39" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.40" osisID="Luke.19.40" n="40" />And he answered, and said to them: I say to you, that if these had been silent, the stones would have cried out.

<p>
<verse eID="Luke.19.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.41" osisID="Luke.19.41" n="41" />And when he came near, he looked upon the city, and wept over it,
<verse eID="Luke.19.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.42" osisID="Luke.19.42" n="42" />saying: Hadst thou known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which were for thy peace! But now, they are hid from thy eyes.
<verse eID="Luke.19.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.43" osisID="Luke.19.43" n="43" />For the days will come upon thee, when thy enemies will throw up a mound about thee, and inclose thee around, and keep thee in on every side,
<verse eID="Luke.19.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.44" osisID="Luke.19.44" n="44" />and will destroy thee and thy children within thee, and will not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

<p>
<verse eID="Luke.19.44" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.45" osisID="Luke.19.45" n="45" />And he went into the temple, and began to drive out those who were selling in it, and those who were buying,
<verse eID="Luke.19.45" />
<verse sID="Luke.19.46" osisID="Luke.19.46" n="46" />and said to them: It is written, My house is a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.

<verse eID="Luke.20.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.2" osisID="Luke.20.2" n="2" />and spoke to him, saying: Tell us by what authority you do these things? or, who is he that gave you this authority?

<verse sID="Luke.20.9" osisID="Luke.20.9" n="9" />And he began to speak this parable to the people: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to vine-dressers, and was absent from home for a long time.
<verse eID="Luke.20.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.10" osisID="Luke.20.10" n="10" />And at the proper season, he sent a servant to those vine-dressers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vine-dressers scourged him, and sent him away empty-handed.
<verse eID="Luke.20.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.11" osisID="Luke.20.11" n="11" />And he then sent another servant. But they scourged him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.

<verse sID="Luke.20.12" osisID="Luke.20.12" n="12" />And he also sent a third; but they wounded him, and drove him out.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.20.12" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.13" osisID="Luke.20.13" n="13" />And the owner of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps, when they see him, they will reverence him.
<verse eID="Luke.20.13" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.14" osisID="Luke.20.14" n="14" />But when the vine-dressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
<verse eID="Luke.20.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.15" osisID="Luke.20.15" n="15" />And they drove him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

<verse sID="Luke.20.17" osisID="Luke.20.17" n="17" />And he looked on them and said: What, then, does this mean, which is written, The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?

<verse sID="Luke.20.18" osisID="Luke.20.18" n="18" />Whoever shall fall on this stone, shall be dashed to pieces; but on whomever it shall fall, it will make him as chaff for the wind.

<verse eID="Luke.20.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.23" osisID="Luke.20.23" n="23" />But he perceived their cunning, and said to them: Why do you tempt me?
<verse eID="Luke.20.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.24" osisID="Luke.20.24" n="24" />Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said: Cæsar’s.
<verse eID="Luke.20.24" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.25" osisID="Luke.20.25" n="25" />He said to them: Give, therefore, to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar s, and to God the things that are God s.
<verse eID="Luke.20.25" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.26" osisID="Luke.20.26" n="26" />And they were not able to take hold of his words before the people. And they were astonished at his answer, and were silent.

<verse eID="Luke.20.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.27" osisID="Luke.20.27" n="27" />Then there came to him some of the Sadducees, (these deny that there is any resurrection,) and asked him,
<verse eID="Luke.20.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.28" osisID="Luke.20.28" n="28" />saying: Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up children for his brother.
<verse eID="Luke.20.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.29" osisID="Luke.20.29" n="29" />There were, therefore, seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died without children;
<verse eID="Luke.20.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.30" osisID="Luke.20.30" n="30" />and the second took his wife, and he died without children;
<verse eID="Luke.20.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.31" osisID="Luke.20.31" n="31" />and the third took her; and in like manner also the seven; and they left no children, and died.
<verse eID="Luke.20.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.32" osisID="Luke.20.32" n="32" />Last of all, the woman also died.
<verse eID="Luke.20.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.33" osisID="Luke.20.33" n="33" />Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of them shall she be the wife? for the seven had her as a wife.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.20.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.34" osisID="Luke.20.34" n="34" />And Jesus answered and said to them: The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.
<verse eID="Luke.20.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.35" osisID="Luke.20.35" n="35" />But those who shall be accounted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
<verse eID="Luke.20.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.36" osisID="Luke.20.36" n="36" />For they can die no more; for they are like the angels, and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.
<verse eID="Luke.20.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.37" osisID="Luke.20.37" n="37" />But: that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at The Bush, since he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
<verse eID="Luke.20.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.38" osisID="Luke.20.38" n="38" />He is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him.
<verse eID="Luke.20.38" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.39" osisID="Luke.20.39" n="39" />And certain of the scribes answered and said: Teacher, thou hast answered well.
<verse eID="Luke.20.39" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.40" osisID="Luke.20.40" n="40" />And after this they durst not ask him any question at all.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.20.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.41" osisID="Luke.20.41" n="41" />But he said to them: How say they that the Christ is the son of David?
<verse eID="Luke.20.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.42" osisID="Luke.20.42" n="42" />Even David himself says, in the book of Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
<verse eID="Luke.20.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.43" osisID="Luke.20.43" n="43" />till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
<verse eID="Luke.20.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.44" osisID="Luke.20.44" n="44" />David, therefore, calls him Lord; and how is he his son?

<p>
<verse eID="Luke.20.44" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.45" osisID="Luke.20.45" n="45" />And while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples:
<verse eID="Luke.20.45" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.46" osisID="Luke.20.46" n="46" />Beware of the scribes, who delight to walk in robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first places at suppers;
<verse eID="Luke.20.46" />
<verse sID="Luke.20.47" osisID="Luke.20.47" n="47" />who eat up the houses of widows, and, for a pretext, make long prayers. These shall receive the greater condemnation.

<verse eID="Luke.21.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.21.8" osisID="Luke.21.8" n="8" />He replied: Take heed that you be not deceived; for many will come in my name, saying: I am he; and, The time is near. Go not, therefore, after them.

<verse sID="Luke.22.47" osisID="Luke.22.47" n="47" />And while he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and came near to Jesus to kiss him.
<verse eID="Luke.22.47" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.48" osisID="Luke.22.48" n="48" />But Jesus said to him: Judas, do you deliver up the Son of man with a kiss?
<verse eID="Luke.22.48" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.49" osisID="Luke.22.49" n="49" />When those who were about him saw what would be done, they said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
<verse eID="Luke.22.49" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.50" osisID="Luke.22.50" n="50" />And a certain one of them struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his right ear.
<verse eID="Luke.22.50" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.51" osisID="Luke.22.51" n="51" />And Jesus answered and said: Let this matter proceed thus far. And he touched his ear and healed him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.22.51" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.52" osisID="Luke.22.52" n="52" />And Jesus said to the chief priests, and the captains of the temple, and the elders that had come against him: Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber?
<verse eID="Luke.22.52" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.53" osisID="Luke.22.53" n="53" />While I was daily with you in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness.
<verse eID="Luke.22.53" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.54" osisID="Luke.22.54" n="54" />And they took him, and led him away, and brought him into the house of the chief priest.

<p>
But Peter followed at a distance.
<verse eID="Luke.22.54" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.55" osisID="Luke.22.55" n="55" />And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat down in the midst of them.
<verse eID="Luke.22.55" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.56" osisID="Luke.22.56" n="56" />And a certain maid-servant saw him sitting by the fire; and, looking intently at him, she said: This man also was with him.
<verse eID="Luke.22.56" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.57" osisID="Luke.22.57" n="57" />But he denied, saying: Woman, I know him not.
<verse eID="Luke.22.57" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.58" osisID="Luke.22.58" n="58" />And after a little, another saw him, and said: You also are one of them. Peter replied: Man, I am not.
<verse eID="Luke.22.58" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.59" osisID="Luke.22.59" n="59" />And about one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.
<verse eID="Luke.22.59" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.60" osisID="Luke.22.60" n="60" />But Peter said: Man, I know not what you say. And immediately, while he was speaking, the cock crew.
<verse eID="Luke.22.60" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.61" osisID="Luke.22.61" n="61" />And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, that he had said to him, Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.
<verse eID="Luke.22.61" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.62" osisID="Luke.22.62" n="62" />And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.22.62" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.63" osisID="Luke.22.63" n="63" />And the men that had Jesus in custody mocked him, and smote him.
<verse eID="Luke.22.63" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.64" osisID="Luke.22.64" n="64" />And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying: Give a response; who is it that struck you?
<verse eID="Luke.22.64" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.65" osisID="Luke.22.65" n="65" />And many other impious things they said to him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.22.65" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.66" osisID="Luke.22.66" n="66" />And when it was day, the elders of the people, the chief priests also and scribes, met together, and led him up to the Sanhedrin, and said:
<verse eID="Luke.22.66" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.67" osisID="Luke.22.67" n="67" />If you are the Christ, tell us. But he said to them: If I tell you, you will not believe;
<verse eID="Luke.22.67" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.68" osisID="Luke.22.68" n="68" />and if I also ask you a question, you will not answer me, nor let me go.
<verse eID="Luke.22.68" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.69" osisID="Luke.22.69" n="69" />Henceforth the Son of man shall sit on the right hand of the power of God.
<verse eID="Luke.22.69" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.70" osisID="Luke.22.70" n="70" />And they all said: You are, then, the Son of God? He said to them: You say that I am.
<verse eID="Luke.22.70" />
<verse sID="Luke.22.71" osisID="Luke.22.71" n="71" />They replied: What further need have we of testimony? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.

<verse eID="Luke.23.1" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.2" osisID="Luke.23.2" n="2" />And they began to accuse him, saying: We found this man turning the people away, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.
<verse eID="Luke.23.2" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.3" osisID="Luke.23.3" n="3" />And Pilate asked him, saying: Are you the king of the Jews? He answered and said to him: You say it.
<verse eID="Luke.23.3" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.4" osisID="Luke.23.4" n="4" />Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no fault in this man.
<verse eID="Luke.23.4" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.5" osisID="Luke.23.5" n="5" />But they became the more urgent, and said: He excites the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.
<verse eID="Luke.23.5" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.6" osisID="Luke.23.6" n="6" />When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the man was a Galilean.

<p>
<verse eID="Luke.23.6" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.7" osisID="Luke.23.7" n="7" />And when he learned that he belonged to the dominion of Herod, he sent him to Herod, who was at that time in Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Luke.23.7" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.8" osisID="Luke.23.8" n="8" />When Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly; for he had, for a long time, desired to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign done by him.
<verse eID="Luke.23.8" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.9" osisID="Luke.23.9" n="9" />And he questioned him concerning many things; but he made him no answer.
<verse eID="Luke.23.9" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.10" osisID="Luke.23.10" n="10" />And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, and vehemently accused him.
<verse eID="Luke.23.10" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.11" osisID="Luke.23.11" n="11" />But Herod and his guards treated him with contempt; and having mocked him, and put on him a gaudy robe, he sent him back to Pilate.
<verse eID="Luke.23.11" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.12" osisID="Luke.23.12" n="12" />And on the same day, Pilate and Herod became friends to each other; for, before this, they had been at enmity the one toward the other.
</p>
<p>

<verse sID="Luke.23.14" osisID="Luke.23.14" n="14" />and said to them: You have brought to me this man as one that turns the people away; and behold, I have examined him before you, and have found in this man no fault, with respect to the things of which you accuse him;
<verse eID="Luke.23.14" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.15" osisID="Luke.23.15" n="15" />nor indeed did Herod; for I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.
<verse eID="Luke.23.15" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.16" osisID="Luke.23.16" n="16" />I will, therefore, chastise him, and release him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.23.16" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.17" osisID="Luke.23.17" n="17" />For it was necessary that he should release to them one at the feast.
<verse eID="Luke.23.17" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.18" osisID="Luke.23.18" n="18" />And the whole multitude cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas.

<verse sID="Luke.23.19" osisID="Luke.23.19" n="19" />He, for a certain seditious movement that had been made in the city, and for murder, had been thrown into prison.

<verse eID="Luke.23.21" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.22" osisID="Luke.23.22" n="22" />He said to them the third time: Why, what evil has he done? I have found nothing in him worthy of death. I will, therefore, chastise him, and release him.
<verse eID="Luke.23.22" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.23" osisID="Luke.23.23" n="23" />But they were urgent with loud voices, demanding that he should be crucified. And their voices, and those of the chief priests, prevailed.
<verse eID="Luke.23.23" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.24" osisID="Luke.23.24" n="24" />And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they demanded.
<verse eID="Luke.23.24" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.25" osisID="Luke.23.25" n="25" />And he released him that for a seditious movement, and for murder, had been thrown into prison, whom they demanded; but Jesus, he delivered up to their will.

<verse sID="Luke.23.27" osisID="Luke.23.27" n="27" />And there followed him a great number of the people, and of women that bewailed and lamented him.
<verse eID="Luke.23.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.28" osisID="Luke.23.28" n="28" />But Jesus turned, and said to them, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.

<verse sID="Luke.23.29" osisID="Luke.23.29" n="29" />For, behold, the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never gave suck.

<verse sID="Luke.23.35" osisID="Luke.23.35" n="35" />And the people stood and looked on. And the rulers, with them scoffed at him, saying: He saved others, let him save himself if he is the Christ, the chosen of God.
<verse eID="Luke.23.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.36" osisID="Luke.23.36" n="36" />The soldiers also derided him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,

<verse sID="Luke.23.40" osisID="Luke.23.40" n="40" />But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Do you not fear God, since you are in the same condemnation?
<verse eID="Luke.23.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.41" osisID="Luke.23.41" n="41" />And we justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.

<verse eID="Luke.23.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.23.43" osisID="Luke.23.43" n="43" />And Jesus said to him: Verily I say to you, to-day you shall be with me in paradise.

<verse sID="Luke.24.25" osisID="Luke.24.25" n="25" />And he said to them: O inconsiderate, and slow of heart to believe all things that the prophets have spoken!
<verse eID="Luke.24.25" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.26" osisID="Luke.24.26" n="26" />Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
<verse eID="Luke.24.26" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.27" osisID="Luke.24.27" n="27" />And beginning from Moses, and all the prophets, he explained to them, in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himself.
<verse eID="Luke.24.27" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.28" osisID="Luke.24.28" n="28" />And they drew near the village to which they were going; and he made as if he would go further.
<verse eID="Luke.24.28" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.29" osisID="Luke.24.29" n="29" />And they constrained him, saying: Remain with us, for it is near the evening, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.24.29" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.30" osisID="Luke.24.30" n="30" />And it came to pass, while he reclined at table with them, that he took bread and blessed; and he broke, and gave it to them.
<verse eID="Luke.24.30" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.31" osisID="Luke.24.31" n="31" />And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he disappeared from them.
<verse eID="Luke.24.31" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.32" osisID="Luke.24.32" n="32" />And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.24.32" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.33" osisID="Luke.24.33" n="33" />And they arose the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven, and those who were with them, assembled,
<verse eID="Luke.24.33" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.34" osisID="Luke.24.34" n="34" />and saying: The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.
<verse eID="Luke.24.34" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.35" osisID="Luke.24.35" n="35" />And they told what had taken place on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.24.35" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.36" osisID="Luke.24.36" n="36" />And while they were speaking of these things, Jesus him self stood in the midst of them, and said to them: Peace be to you.
<verse eID="Luke.24.36" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.37" osisID="Luke.24.37" n="37" />But they were terrified and frightened, and thought that they saw a spirit.
<verse eID="Luke.24.37" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.38" osisID="Luke.24.38" n="38" />And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
<verse eID="Luke.24.38" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.39" osisID="Luke.24.39" n="39" />See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.
<verse eID="Luke.24.39" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.40" osisID="Luke.24.40" n="40" />And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
<verse eID="Luke.24.40" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.41" osisID="Luke.24.41" n="41" />And while they did not believe as yet for joy, and were astonished, he said to them: Have you any thing here to eat?
<verse eID="Luke.24.41" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.42" osisID="Luke.24.42" n="42" />And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of a honeycomb.
<verse eID="Luke.24.42" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.43" osisID="Luke.24.43" n="43" />And he took it, and did eat before them.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.24.43" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.44" osisID="Luke.24.44" n="44" />And he said to them: These are the words that I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled that are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
<verse eID="Luke.24.44" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.45" osisID="Luke.24.45" n="45" />Then he opened their mind, that they might understand the scriptures,
<verse eID="Luke.24.45" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.46" osisID="Luke.24.46" n="46" />and he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus was it necessary that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day,
<verse eID="Luke.24.46" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.47" osisID="Luke.24.47" n="47" />and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Luke.24.47" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.48" osisID="Luke.24.48" n="48" />You are witnesses of these things.
<verse eID="Luke.24.48" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.49" osisID="Luke.24.49" n="49" />And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you. But do you remain in the city of Jerusalem, till you be clothed with power from on high.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Luke.24.49" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.50" osisID="Luke.24.50" n="50" />And he led them out as far as Bethany; and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
<verse eID="Luke.24.50" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.51" osisID="Luke.24.51" n="51" />And it came to pass, that as he blessed them, he was separated from them, and carried up into heaven.
<verse eID="Luke.24.51" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.52" osisID="Luke.24.52" n="52" />And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy;
<verse eID="Luke.24.52" />
<verse sID="Luke.24.53" osisID="Luke.24.53" n="53" />and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.

<p>
<verse sID="John.1.1" osisID="John.1.1" n="1" />In the beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with God, and the WORD was God.
<verse eID="John.1.1" />
<verse sID="John.1.2" osisID="John.1.2" n="2" />He was in the beginning with God.
<verse eID="John.1.2" />
<verse sID="John.1.3" osisID="John.1.3" n="3" />All things were made by him, and without him not one thing was made that now exists.
<verse eID="John.1.3" />
<verse sID="John.1.4" osisID="John.1.4" n="4" />In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
<verse eID="John.1.4" />
<verse sID="John.1.5" osisID="John.1.5" n="5" />And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness comprehends it not.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.1.5" />
<verse sID="John.1.6" osisID="John.1.6" n="6" />There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
<verse eID="John.1.6" />
<verse sID="John.1.7" osisID="John.1.7" n="7" />This man came as a witness, to testify of the Light, that all through him might believe.
<verse eID="John.1.7" />
<verse sID="John.1.8" osisID="John.1.8" n="8" />He was not the Light; but he came to testify of the Light.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.1.8" />
<verse sID="John.1.9" osisID="John.1.9" n="9" />He was the true Light, which, coming into the world, gives light to every man.
<verse eID="John.1.9" />
<verse sID="John.1.10" osisID="John.1.10" n="10" />He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
<verse eID="John.1.10" />
<verse sID="John.1.11" osisID="John.1.11" n="11" />He came to his own country, and his own people received him not.
<verse eID="John.1.11" />
<verse sID="John.1.12" osisID="John.1.12" n="12" />But as many as received him, to them he gave the privilege of becoming the children of God, even to those who believe on his name;
<verse eID="John.1.12" />
<verse sID="John.1.13" osisID="John.1.13" n="13" />who were begotten, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
<verse eID="John.1.13" />
<verse sID="John.1.14" osisID="John.1.14" n="14" />And the WORD became flesh, and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and of truth.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.1.14" />
<verse sID="John.1.15" osisID="John.1.15" n="15" />John testified of him, and cried, saying: This is he of whom I said: He that comes after me, is now before me, for he existed before me.
<verse eID="John.1.15" />
<verse sID="John.1.16" osisID="John.1.16" n="16" />And from his fullness have we all received, even grace for grace;
<verse eID="John.1.16" />
<verse sID="John.1.17" osisID="John.1.17" n="17" />for the law was given through Moses, but the grace and the truth came through Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="John.1.17" />
<verse sID="John.1.18" osisID="John.1.18" n="18" />No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has revealed him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.1.18" />
<verse sID="John.1.19" osisID="John.1.19" n="19" />And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him: Who are you?
<verse eID="John.1.19" />
<verse sID="John.1.20" osisID="John.1.20" n="20" />And he confessed, and did not deny; and he confessed: I am not the Christ.
<verse eID="John.1.20" />
<verse sID="John.1.21" osisID="John.1.21" n="21" />And they asked him: What then? Are you Elijah? And he said: I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered: No.
<verse eID="John.1.21" />
<verse sID="John.1.22" osisID="John.1.22" n="22" />They then said to him: Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us; what say you of yourself?
<verse eID="John.1.22" />
<verse sID="John.1.23" osisID="John.1.23" n="23" />He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord; as said the prophet Isaiah.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.1.23" />
<verse sID="John.1.24" osisID="John.1.24" n="24" />And those who were sent were of the Pharisees;
<verse eID="John.1.24" />
<verse sID="John.1.25" osisID="John.1.25" n="25" />and they asked him, and said to him: Why, then, do you immerse, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?
<verse eID="John.1.25" />
<verse sID="John.1.26" osisID="John.1.26" n="26" />John answered them, saying: I immerse in water; but there stands one among you whom you know not.
<verse eID="John.1.26" />
<verse sID="John.1.27" osisID="John.1.27" n="27" />He it is, who, though he comes after me, is now before me; the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to loose.
<verse eID="John.1.27" />
<verse sID="John.1.28" osisID="John.1.28" n="28" />These things were done in Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.1.28" />
<verse sID="John.1.29" osisID="John.1.29" n="29" />The next day John saw Jesus coming to him, and said: Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world.
<verse eID="John.1.29" />
<verse sID="John.1.30" osisID="John.1.30" n="30" />This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is now before me, for he existed before me.
<verse eID="John.1.30" />
<verse sID="John.1.31" osisID="John.1.31" n="31" />And I knew him not; but that he might be made manifest to Israel, for this reason I have come immersing in water.
<verse eID="John.1.31" />
<verse sID="John.1.32" osisID="John.1.32" n="32" />And John testified, saying: I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.
<verse eID="John.1.32" />
<verse sID="John.1.33" osisID="John.1.33" n="33" />And I knew him not; but he that sent me to immerse in water, said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining, this is he that immerses in the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="John.1.33" />
<verse sID="John.1.34" osisID="John.1.34" n="34" />And I saw, and do testify that this is the Son of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.1.34" />
<verse sID="John.1.35" osisID="John.1.35" n="35" />Again the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples.
<verse eID="John.1.35" />
<verse sID="John.1.36" osisID="John.1.36" n="36" />And looking on Jesus as he walked, he said: Behold the Lamb of God.
<verse eID="John.1.36" />
<verse sID="John.1.37" osisID="John.1.37" n="37" />And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
<verse eID="John.1.37" />
<verse sID="John.1.38" osisID="John.1.38" n="38" />And Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them:
<verse eID="John.1.38" />
<verse sID="John.1.39" osisID="John.1.39" n="39" />What do you seek? They said to him: Rabbi, (which, when translated, is called Teacher,) where abidest thou?
<verse eID="John.1.39" />
<verse sID="John.1.40" osisID="John.1.40" n="40" />He said to them: Come and see. They went and saw where he abode; and they remained with him that day; for it was about the tenth hour.
<verse eID="John.1.40" />
<verse sID="John.1.41" osisID="John.1.41" n="41" />One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.
<verse eID="John.1.41" />
<verse sID="John.1.42" osisID="John.1.42" n="42" />He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him: We have found the Messiah; (which, when translated, is the Christ;)
<verse eID="John.1.42" />
<verse sID="John.1.43" osisID="John.1.43" n="43" />and he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looking on him, said: You are Simon, the son of Jonah; you shall be called Cephas (which, when translated, is Rock).
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.1.43" />
<verse sID="John.1.44" osisID="John.1.44" n="44" />The day following, Jesus wished to go into Galilee; and he found Philip, and said to him: Follow me.
<verse eID="John.1.44" />
<verse sID="John.1.45" osisID="John.1.45" n="45" />Now, Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
<verse eID="John.1.45" />
<verse sID="John.1.46" osisID="John.1.46" n="46" />Philip found Nathaniel, and said to him: We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
<verse eID="John.1.46" />
<verse sID="John.1.47" osisID="John.1.47" n="47" />And Nathaniel said to him: Can any thing good come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him: Come and see.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.1.47" />
<verse sID="John.1.48" osisID="John.1.48" n="48" />Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, and said of him: Be hold, an Israelite in truth, in whom there is no guile.
<verse eID="John.1.48" />
<verse sID="John.1.49" osisID="John.1.49" n="49" />Nathaniel said to him: How knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him: Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig-tree, I saw you.
<verse eID="John.1.49" />
<verse sID="John.1.50" osisID="John.1.50" n="50" />Nathaniel answered and said to him: Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
<verse eID="John.1.50" />
<verse sID="John.1.51" osisID="John.1.51" n="51" />Jesus answered and said to him: Do you believe, because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree? You shall see greater things than these. And he said to him: Verily, verily I say to you, From this time you shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

<chapter sID="John.2" osisID="John.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="John.2.1" osisID="John.2.1" n="1" />And on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.
<verse eID="John.2.1" />
<verse sID="John.2.2" osisID="John.2.2" n="2" />And both Jesus and his disciples were invited to the marriage.
<verse eID="John.2.2" />
<verse sID="John.2.3" osisID="John.2.3" n="3" />And the wine having failed, the mother of Jesus said to him: They have no wine.
<verse eID="John.2.3" />
<verse sID="John.2.4" osisID="John.2.4" n="4" />Jesus said to her: Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour has not yet come.
<verse eID="John.2.4" />
<verse sID="John.2.5" osisID="John.2.5" n="5" />His mother said to the servants: Whatever he says to you, do.
<verse eID="John.2.5" />
<verse sID="John.2.6" osisID="John.2.6" n="6" />Now, according to the Jewish custom of purifying, six water-pots of stone had been set there, containing each two or three baths.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.2.6" />
<verse sID="John.2.7" osisID="John.2.7" n="7" />Jesus said to them: Fill the water-pots with water. And they filled them to the brim.
<verse eID="John.2.7" />
<verse sID="John.2.8" osisID="John.2.8" n="8" />And he said to them: Draw out now, and carry it to the governor of the feast. And they carried it.
<verse eID="John.2.8" />
<verse sID="John.2.9" osisID="John.2.9" n="9" />When the governor of the feast had tasted the water that had been made wine, (and he knew not whence it was, but the servants that had drawn the water knew,) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and said to him:
<verse eID="John.2.9" />
<verse sID="John.2.10" osisID="John.2.10" n="10" />Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is inferior; but you have kept the good wino till now.
<verse eID="John.2.10" />
<verse sID="John.2.11" osisID="John.2.11" n="11" />This beginning of signs Jesus made in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.2.11" />
<verse sID="John.2.12" osisID="John.2.12" n="12" />After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples. And they continued there not many days.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.2.12" />
<verse sID="John.2.13" osisID="John.2.13" n="13" />And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="John.2.13" />
<verse sID="John.2.14" osisID="John.2.14" n="14" />And he found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.
<verse eID="John.2.14" />
<verse sID="John.2.15" osisID="John.2.15" n="15" />And when he had made a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep also, and the oxen, and he poured out the money of the money-changers, and overthrew their tables;
<verse eID="John.2.15" />
<verse sID="John.2.16" osisID="John.2.16" n="16" />and said to those who sold doves: Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.
<verse eID="John.2.16" />
<verse sID="John.2.17" osisID="John.2.17" n="17" />And his disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house has eaten me up.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.2.17" />
<verse sID="John.2.18" osisID="John.2.18" n="18" />Then answered the Jews and said to him: What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?
<verse eID="John.2.18" />
<verse sID="John.2.19" osisID="John.2.19" n="19" />Jesus answered and said to them: Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days.
<verse eID="John.2.19" />
<verse sID="John.2.20" osisID="John.2.20" n="20" />Then the Jews said to him: Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you rebuild it in three days?
<verse eID="John.2.20" />
<verse sID="John.2.21" osisID="John.2.21" n="21" />But he spoke of the temple of his body.
<verse eID="John.2.21" />
<verse sID="John.2.22" osisID="John.2.22" n="22" />When, therefore, he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. And they believed the scripture, and the word that Jesus had spoken.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.2.22" />
<verse sID="John.2.23" osisID="John.2.23" n="23" />And while he was in Jerusalem, during the feast of passover, many believed on his name, because they saw the signs that he did.
<verse eID="John.2.23" />
<verse sID="John.2.24" osisID="John.2.24" n="24" />But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,
<verse eID="John.2.24" />
<verse sID="John.2.25" osisID="John.2.25" n="25" />and had no need that any one should testify of man, for he himself knew what was in man.

<verse eID="John.3.1" />
<verse sID="John.3.2" osisID="John.3.2" n="2" />This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou hast come as a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs which thou doest, unless God be with him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.3.2" />
<verse sID="John.3.3" osisID="John.3.3" n="3" />Jesus answered and said to him: Verily, verily I say to you, unless a man be born again, he can not see the kingdom of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.3.3" />
<verse sID="John.3.4" osisID="John.3.4" n="4" />Nicodemus said to him: How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother’s womb the second time, and be born?

<verse sID="John.3.5" osisID="John.3.5" n="5" />Jesus answered: Verily, verily I say to you, unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he can not enter into the kingdom of God.
<verse eID="John.3.5" />
<verse sID="John.3.6" osisID="John.3.6" n="6" />That which is begotten of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is begotten of the Spirit, is spirit.
<verse eID="John.3.6" />
<verse sID="John.3.7" osisID="John.3.7" n="7" />Wonder not that I said to you, you must all be born again,
<verse eID="John.3.7" />
<verse sID="John.3.8" osisID="John.3.8" n="8" />The Spirit breathes where he pleases, and you hear his voice, but you know not whence he comes, and whither he goes; so is every one that is begotten of the Spirit.

<verse sID="John.3.9" osisID="John.3.9" n="9" />Nicodemus answered and said to him: How can these things be?
<verse eID="John.3.9" />
<verse sID="John.3.10" osisID="John.3.10" n="10" />Jesus answered and said to him: Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?
<verse eID="John.3.10" />
<verse sID="John.3.11" osisID="John.3.11" n="11" />Verily, verily, I say to you, we speak that which we know, and testify to that which we have seen; and you receive not our testimony.
<verse eID="John.3.11" />
<verse sID="John.3.12" osisID="John.3.12" n="12" />If I have told you of earthly things, and you believe not, how will you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
<verse eID="John.3.12" />
<verse sID="John.3.13" osisID="John.3.13" n="13" />And no man has ascended into heaven, but he who came down from heaven, the Son of man, who is in heaven.
<verse eID="John.3.13" />
<verse sID="John.3.14" osisID="John.3.14" n="14" />And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up;
<verse eID="John.3.14" />
<verse sID="John.3.15" osisID="John.3.15" n="15" />that whoever believes on him may not perish, but have eternal life.
<verse eID="John.3.15" />
<verse sID="John.3.16" osisID="John.3.16" n="16" />For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes on him should not perish, but have eternal life.
<verse eID="John.3.16" />
<verse sID="John.3.17" osisID="John.3.17" n="17" />For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world, through him, might be saved.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.3.17" />
<verse sID="John.3.18" osisID="John.3.18" n="18" />He that believes on him is not condemned; but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.
<verse eID="John.3.18" />
<verse sID="John.3.19" osisID="John.3.19" n="19" />And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
<verse eID="John.3.19" />
<verse sID="John.3.20" osisID="John.3.20" n="20" />For every one that does evil, hates the light, and comes not to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.
<verse eID="John.3.20" />
<verse sID="John.3.21" osisID="John.3.21" n="21" />But he that does the truth, comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are done in God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.3.21" />
<verse sID="John.3.22" osisID="John.3.22" n="22" />After these things, Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea, and he remained there with them, and immersed.
<verse eID="John.3.22" />
<verse sID="John.3.23" osisID="John.3.23" n="23" />And John also was immersing in Ænon, near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed;
<verse eID="John.3.23" />
<verse sID="John.3.24" osisID="John.3.24" n="24" />for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.3.24" />
<verse sID="John.3.25" osisID="John.3.25" n="25" />There arose, therefore, a dispute between some of John’s disciples and a Jew, about purification.
<verse eID="John.3.25" />
<verse sID="John.3.26" osisID="John.3.26" n="26" />And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore testimony, behold, he immerses, and all are going to him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.3.26" />
<verse sID="John.3.27" osisID="John.3.27" n="27" />John answered and said: A man can receive nothing unless it be given to him from heaven.
<verse eID="John.3.27" />
<verse sID="John.3.28" osisID="John.3.28" n="28" />You yourselves will testify for me, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
<verse eID="John.3.28" />
<verse sID="John.3.29" osisID="John.3.29" n="29" />He that has the bride, is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly on account of the voice of the bridegroom. This, my joy, is therefore complete.
<verse eID="John.3.29" />
<verse sID="John.3.30" osisID="John.3.30" n="30" />He must increase, but I must decrease.

<verse sID="John.3.31" osisID="John.3.31" n="31" />He that comes from above, is over all. He that is from the earth, is from the earth, and speaks from the earth. He that comes from heaven, is over all;
<verse eID="John.3.31" />
<verse sID="John.3.32" osisID="John.3.32" n="32" />and what he has seen and heard, this he testifies; and no one receives his testimony.
<verse eID="John.3.32" />
<verse sID="John.3.33" osisID="John.3.33" n="33" />He that has received his testimony has solemnly declared that God is true.
<verse eID="John.3.33" />
<verse sID="John.3.34" osisID="John.3.34" n="34" />For he whom God has sent, speaks the words of God; for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.
<verse eID="John.3.34" />
<verse sID="John.3.35" osisID="John.3.35" n="35" />The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
<verse eID="John.3.35" />
<verse sID="John.3.36" osisID="John.3.36" n="36" />He that believes on the Son has eternal life. But he that believes not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.

<chapter sID="John.4" osisID="John.4" n="4" />
<verse sID="John.4.1" osisID="John.4.1" n="1" />When, therefore, the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and immersing more disciples than John,
<verse eID="John.4.1" />
<verse sID="John.4.2" osisID="John.4.2" n="2" />(though not Jesus himself, but his disciples immersed,)
<verse eID="John.4.2" />
<verse sID="John.4.3" osisID="John.4.3" n="3" />he left Judea, and went again into Galilee.
<verse eID="John.4.3" />
<verse sID="John.4.4" osisID="John.4.4" n="4" />And it was necessary that he should go through Samaria.
<verse eID="John.4.4" />
<verse sID="John.4.5" osisID="John.4.5" n="5" />He came, therefore, to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
<verse eID="John.4.5" />
<verse sID="John.4.6" osisID="John.4.6" n="6" />And Jacob’s well was there. Jesus, therefore, wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.4.6" />
<verse sID="John.4.7" osisID="John.4.7" n="7" />There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. And Jesus said to her: Give me to drink.
<verse eID="John.4.7" />
<verse sID="John.4.8" osisID="John.4.8" n="8" />For his disciples had gone into the city to buy food.
<verse eID="John.4.8" />
<verse sID="John.4.9" osisID="John.4.9" n="9" />Then the woman of Samaria said to him: How is it that you, who are a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? (For the Jews have no social intercourse with the Samaritans.)
<verse eID="John.4.9" />
<verse sID="John.4.10" osisID="John.4.10" n="10" />Jesus answered and said to her: If you had known the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink, you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.
<verse eID="John.4.10" />
<verse sID="John.4.11" osisID="John.4.11" n="11" />The woman said to him: Sir, you have no vessel with which you can draw, and the well is deep; whence have you that living water?
<verse eID="John.4.11" />
<verse sID="John.4.12" osisID="John.4.12" n="12" />Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.4.12" />

<verse sID="John.4.14" osisID="John.4.14" n="14" />but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him, shall never thirst. But the water that I will give him, shall be in him a fountain of water springing up in order to eternal life.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.4.14" />
<verse sID="John.4.15" osisID="John.4.15" n="15" />The woman said to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.

<p>
<verse eID="John.4.15" />
<verse sID="John.4.16" osisID="John.4.16" n="16" />Jesus said to her: Go, call your husband, and come hither.

<verse sID="John.4.17" osisID="John.4.17" n="17" />The woman answered and said: I have no husband.

<p>
Jesus said to her: You have well said. I have no husband;
<verse eID="John.4.17" />
<verse sID="John.4.18" osisID="John.4.18" n="18" />for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband. In this you have spoken truly.
<verse eID="John.4.18" />
<verse sID="John.4.19" osisID="John.4.19" n="19" />The woman said to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

<verse sID="John.4.21" osisID="John.4.21" n="21" />Jesus said to her: Woman, believe me, the hour is coming, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.
<verse eID="John.4.21" />
<verse sID="John.4.22" osisID="John.4.22" n="22" />You worship you know not what; we know what we worship; for salvation is of the Jews.
<verse eID="John.4.22" />
<verse sID="John.4.23" osisID="John.4.23" n="23" />But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeks such to worship him.
<verse eID="John.4.23" />
<verse sID="John.4.24" osisID="John.4.24" n="24" />God is spirit; and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.

<p>
<verse eID="John.4.25" />
<verse sID="John.4.26" osisID="John.4.26" n="26" />Jesus said to her: I who speak to you am he.
<verse eID="John.4.26" />
<verse sID="John.4.27" osisID="John.4.27" n="27" />And upon this his disciples came, and were astonished that he was talking with the woman. Yet no one said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.4.27" />
<verse sID="John.4.28" osisID="John.4.28" n="28" />Then the woman left her water-pot, and went into the city, and said to the men:

<verse eID="John.4.29" />
<verse sID="John.4.30" osisID="John.4.30" n="30" />Then they went out of the city and came to him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.4.30" />
<verse sID="John.4.31" osisID="John.4.31" n="31" />In the mean time, the disciples besought him, saying: Rabbi, eat.
<verse eID="John.4.31" />
<verse sID="John.4.32" osisID="John.4.32" n="32" />But he said to them: I have food to eat of which you know not.
<verse eID="John.4.32" />
<verse sID="John.4.33" osisID="John.4.33" n="33" />Then the disciples said one to another: Has any one brought him food?
<verse eID="John.4.33" />
<verse sID="John.4.34" osisID="John.4.34" n="34" />Jesus said to them: My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

<verse sID="John.4.35" osisID="John.4.35" n="35" />Do you not say, There are yet four months, and harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, for they are already white for the harvest.
<verse eID="John.4.35" />
<verse sID="John.4.36" osisID="John.4.36" n="36" />And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for life eternal; that he that sows, and he that reaps, may rejoice together.

<verse eID="John.4.37" />
<verse sID="John.4.38" osisID="John.4.38" n="38" />I have sent you to reap that on which you bestowed no labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.

<p>
<verse eID="John.4.38" />
<verse sID="John.4.39" osisID="John.4.39" n="39" />And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him, because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all things that I ever did.
<verse eID="John.4.39" />
<verse sID="John.4.40" osisID="John.4.40" n="40" />When, therefore, the Samaritans came to him, they besought him to abide with them. And he abode there two days.
<verse eID="John.4.40" />
<verse sID="John.4.41" osisID="John.4.41" n="41" />And many more believed because of his own word;
<verse eID="John.4.41" />
<verse sID="John.4.42" osisID="John.4.42" n="42" />and they said to the woman: We no longer believe because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this is in truth the Savior of the world, the Christ.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.4.42" />
<verse sID="John.4.43" osisID="John.4.43" n="43" />And after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee;
<verse eID="John.4.43" />
<verse sID="John.4.44" osisID="John.4.44" n="44" />for Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
<verse eID="John.4.44" />
<verse sID="John.4.45" osisID="John.4.45" n="45" />Therefore, when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, because they had seen all things that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast; for they themselves had gone to the feast.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.4.45" />
<verse sID="John.4.46" osisID="John.4.46" n="46" />Then Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain courtier, whose sou was sick in Capernaum.
<verse eID="John.4.46" />
<verse sID="John.4.47" osisID="John.4.47" n="47" />When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him that he would come down, and restore his son to health, for he was about to die.
<verse eID="John.4.47" />
<verse sID="John.4.48" osisID="John.4.48" n="48" />Then said Jesus to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.
<verse eID="John.4.48" />
<verse sID="John.4.49" osisID="John.4.49" n="49" />The courtier said to him: Sir, come down before my child die.
<verse eID="John.4.49" />
<verse sID="John.4.50" osisID="John.4.50" n="50" />Jesus said to him: Go, your child lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke, and departed.
<verse eID="John.4.50" />
<verse sID="John.4.51" osisID="John.4.51" n="51" />And as he was going down, his servants met him, and said: Your son lives.
<verse eID="John.4.51" />
<verse sID="John.4.52" osisID="John.4.52" n="52" />Then he inquired of them the hour in which he was restored to health. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.
<verse eID="John.4.52" />
<verse sID="John.4.53" osisID="John.4.53" n="53" />Then his father knew that it was in the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself, and all his house, believed.
<verse eID="John.4.53" />
<verse sID="John.4.54" osisID="John.4.54" n="54" />This is the second sign which Jesus did, when he came out of Judea into Galilee.

<verse eID="John.5.1" />
<verse sID="John.5.2" osisID="John.5.2" n="2" />Now there is in Jerusalem, near the sheepgate, a pool, called, in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, with five porches.
<verse eID="John.5.2" />
<verse sID="John.5.3" osisID="John.5.3" n="3" />In these lay a great multitude of sick persons, blind, lame, withered, who waited for the moving of the water.
<verse eID="John.5.3" />
<verse sID="John.5.4" osisID="John.5.4" n="4" />For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and stirred the water. Then he who entered first after the motion of the water, was cured of whatever disease he had.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.5.4" />
<verse sID="John.5.5" osisID="John.5.5" n="5" />And a certain man was there, who had been sick thirty-eight years.

<verse sID="John.5.6" osisID="John.5.6" n="6" />When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been already a long time in that condition, he said to him: Do you wish to be restored to health?
<verse eID="John.5.6" />
<verse sID="John.5.7" osisID="John.5.7" n="7" />The sick man answered him: Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.
<verse eID="John.5.7" />
<verse sID="John.5.8" osisID="John.5.8" n="8" />Jesus said to him: Arise, take up your bed and walk.
<verse eID="John.5.8" />
<verse sID="John.5.9" osisID="John.5.9" n="9" />And the man was immediately restored to health; and he took up his bed and walked. And that day was the sabbath.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.5.9" />
<verse sID="John.5.10" osisID="John.5.10" n="10" />The Jews, therefore, said to him that was cured: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.
<verse eID="John.5.10" />
<verse sID="John.5.11" osisID="John.5.11" n="11" />He answered them: He that restored me to health said to me, Take up your bed and walk.
<verse eID="John.5.11" />
<verse sID="John.5.12" osisID="John.5.12" n="12" />Then they asked him: Who is he that said to you, Take up your bed and walk?
<verse eID="John.5.12" />
<verse sID="John.5.13" osisID="John.5.13" n="13" />But he that had been restored to health knew not who he was; for Jesus had withdrawn himself, because a multitude was in the place.
<verse eID="John.5.13" />
<verse sID="John.5.14" osisID="John.5.14" n="14" />After this Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him: Behold, you have been restored to health; sin no more, lest some worse thing befall you.
<verse eID="John.5.14" />
<verse sID="John.5.15" osisID="John.5.15" n="15" />The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus that had restored him to health.
<verse eID="John.5.15" />
<verse sID="John.5.16" osisID="John.5.16" n="16" />And for this reason did the Jews persecute Jesus, and seek to kill him, because he had done these things on the sabbath.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.5.16" />
<verse sID="John.5.17" osisID="John.5.17" n="17" />But Jesus answered them: My Father works till now, and I also work.
<verse eID="John.5.17" />
<verse sID="John.5.18" osisID="John.5.18" n="18" />For this reason, therefore, the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only broken the sabbath, but also said that God was his own father, making himself equal with God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.5.18" />
<verse sID="John.5.19" osisID="John.5.19" n="19" />Then Jesus answered and said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do; for whatever things he does, these also the Son does in like manner.
<verse eID="John.5.19" />
<verse sID="John.5.20" osisID="John.5.20" n="20" />For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may be astonished.
<verse eID="John.5.20" />
<verse sID="John.5.21" osisID="John.5.21" n="21" />For as the Father raises the dead, and makes them alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he will.
<verse eID="John.5.21" />
<verse sID="John.5.22" osisID="John.5.22" n="22" />For the Father judges no one, but has given all judicial authority to the Son;
<verse eID="John.5.22" />
<verse sID="John.5.23" osisID="John.5.23" n="23" />that all may honor the Son, as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father who sent him.

<verse sID="John.5.25" osisID="John.5.25" n="25" />Verily, verily I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear, shall live.
<verse eID="John.5.25" />
<verse sID="John.5.26" osisID="John.5.26" n="26" />For as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son also to have life in himself;
<verse eID="John.5.26" />
<verse sID="John.5.27" osisID="John.5.27" n="27" />and he has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
<verse eID="John.5.27" />
<verse sID="John.5.28" osisID="John.5.28" n="28" />Be not astonished at this; for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
<verse eID="John.5.28" />
<verse sID="John.5.29" osisID="John.5.29" n="29" />and shall come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.
<verse eID="John.5.29" />
<verse sID="John.5.30" osisID="John.5.30" n="30" />I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.5.30" />
<verse sID="John.5.31" osisID="John.5.31" n="31" />If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not worthy of credit.
<verse eID="John.5.31" />
<verse sID="John.5.32" osisID="John.5.32" n="32" />There is another that testifies concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies concerning me is worthy of credit.
<verse eID="John.5.32" />
<verse sID="John.5.33" osisID="John.5.33" n="33" />You sent to John, and he bore testimony to the truth.
<verse eID="John.5.33" />
<verse sID="John.5.34" osisID="John.5.34" n="34" />But I receive not testimony from man; yet I say these things that you may be saved.
<verse eID="John.5.34" />
<verse sID="John.5.35" osisID="John.5.35" n="35" />He was the burning and shining lamp; and you were willing, for a time, to rejoice in his light.
<verse eID="John.5.35" />
<verse sID="John.5.36" osisID="John.5.36" n="36" />But I have testimony greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these very works which I do, testify concerning me, that the Father has sent me.
<verse eID="John.5.36" />
<verse sID="John.5.37" osisID="John.5.37" n="37" />And the Father, who sent me, has testified concerning me. You have, neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
<verse eID="John.5.37" />
<verse sID="John.5.38" osisID="John.5.38" n="38" />And his word you have not remaining in you; for whom he has sent, him you believe not.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.5.38" />
<verse sID="John.5.39" osisID="John.5.39" n="39" />You search the scriptures, because in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify concerning me:
<verse eID="John.5.39" />
<verse sID="John.5.40" osisID="John.5.40" n="40" />and yet you refuse to come to me, that you may have life.
<verse eID="John.5.40" />
<verse sID="John.5.41" osisID="John.5.41" n="41" />I receive not honor from men.
<verse eID="John.5.41" />
<verse sID="John.5.42" osisID="John.5.42" n="42" />But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.
<verse eID="John.5.42" />
<verse sID="John.5.43" osisID="John.5.43" n="43" />I have come in my Father’s name, and you receive me not; if another should come in his own name, him you would receive.
<verse eID="John.5.43" />
<verse sID="John.5.44" osisID="John.5.44" n="44" />How can you believe who receive honor one from another, and seek not the honor that comes from God alone?
<verse eID="John.5.44" />
<verse sID="John.5.45" osisID="John.5.45" n="45" />Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, Moses, in whom you trust.
<verse eID="John.5.45" />
<verse sID="John.5.46" osisID="John.5.46" n="46" />For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.
<verse eID="John.5.46" />
<verse sID="John.5.47" osisID="John.5.47" n="47" />But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?

<chapter sID="John.6" osisID="John.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="John.6.1" osisID="John.6.1" n="1" />After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
<verse eID="John.6.1" />
<verse sID="John.6.2" osisID="John.6.2" n="2" />And a great multitude followed him, because they had seen the signs which he did in the case of the sick.
<verse eID="John.6.2" />
<verse sID="John.6.3" osisID="John.6.3" n="3" />And Jesus went up into the mountain, and sat there with his disciples.
<verse eID="John.6.3" />
<verse sID="John.6.4" osisID="John.6.4" n="4" />And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
<verse eID="John.6.4" />
<verse sID="John.6.5" osisID="John.6.5" n="5" />Then Jesus, lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?
<verse eID="John.6.5" />
<verse sID="John.6.6" osisID="John.6.6" n="6" />But this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he was about to do.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.6" />
<verse sID="John.6.7" osisID="John.6.7" n="7" />Philip answered him: Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for them, that each may take a little.
<verse eID="John.6.7" />
<verse sID="John.6.8" osisID="John.6.8" n="8" />One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him:
<verse eID="John.6.8" />
<verse sID="John.6.9" osisID="John.6.9" n="9" />There is a lad here that has five barley loaves, and two little fishes; but what are these among so many?
<verse eID="John.6.9" />
<verse sID="John.6.10" osisID="John.6.10" n="10" />But Jesus said: Make die men recline. Now, there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, in number about five thousand.
<verse eID="John.6.10" />
<verse sID="John.6.11" osisID="John.6.11" n="11" />And Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks, distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who had reclined; and in like manner of the fishes, as much as they wished.
<verse eID="John.6.11" />
<verse sID="John.6.12" osisID="John.6.12" n="12" />And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples: Gather up the broken pieces which remain, that nothing be lost.
<verse eID="John.6.12" />
<verse sID="John.6.13" osisID="John.6.13" n="13" />Then they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the broken pieces of the five barley loaves, which remained after they had eaten.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.13" />
<verse sID="John.6.14" osisID="John.6.14" n="14" />Then the men, after having seen the sign which Jesus did, said: This is, in truth, the prophet that was to come into the world.
<verse eID="John.6.14" />
<verse sID="John.6.15" osisID="John.6.15" n="15" />Therefore, Jesus perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew into the mountain himself alone.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.15" />
<verse sID="John.6.16" osisID="John.6.16" n="16" />And when evening had come, his disciples went down to the sea,
<verse eID="John.6.16" />
<verse sID="John.6.17" osisID="John.6.17" n="17" />and, having entered the ship, went across the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
<verse eID="John.6.17" />
<verse sID="John.6.18" osisID="John.6.18" n="18" />And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that was blowing.
<verse eID="John.6.18" />
<verse sID="John.6.19" osisID="John.6.19" n="19" />Then, having rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and coming near the ship; and they were afraid.
<verse eID="John.6.19" />
<verse sID="John.6.20" osisID="John.6.20" n="20" />But he said to them: It is I; be not afraid.
<verse eID="John.6.20" />
<verse sID="John.6.21" osisID="John.6.21" n="21" />Then they willingly received him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they were going.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.21" />
<verse sID="John.6.22" osisID="John.6.22" n="22" />The next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, seeing that no other boat had been there but the one which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone;
<verse eID="John.6.22" />
<verse sID="John.6.23" osisID="John.6.23" n="23" />(but there came other boats from Tiberias near the place where they had eaten bread, after the Lord had given thanks;)
<verse eID="John.6.23" />
<verse sID="John.6.24" osisID="John.6.24" n="24" />when, therefore, the multitude saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they also entered the ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.24" />
<verse sID="John.6.25" osisID="John.6.25" n="25" />And finding him on the opposite side of the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when didst thou come hither?
<verse eID="John.6.25" />
<verse sID="John.6.26" osisID="John.6.26" n="26" />Jesus answered them, and said: Verily, verily I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.
<verse eID="John.6.26" />
<verse sID="John.6.27" osisID="John.6.27" n="27" />Labor not for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to life eternal, which the Son of man will give you; for him has God the Father attested.
<verse eID="John.6.27" />
<verse sID="John.6.28" osisID="John.6.28" n="28" />Then they said to him: What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?
<verse eID="John.6.28" />
<verse sID="John.6.29" osisID="John.6.29" n="29" />Jesus answered and said to them: This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.
<verse eID="John.6.29" />
<verse sID="John.6.30" osisID="John.6.30" n="30" />Therefore, they said to him: What sign do you show, then, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you perform?
<verse eID="John.6.30" />
<verse sID="John.6.31" osisID="John.6.31" n="31" />Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.31" />
<verse sID="John.6.32" osisID="John.6.32" n="32" />Then Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
<verse eID="John.6.32" />
<verse sID="John.6.33" osisID="John.6.33" n="33" />For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven, and gives life for the world.
<verse eID="John.6.33" />
<verse sID="John.6.34" osisID="John.6.34" n="34" />Then they said to him: Lord, evermore give us this bread.
<verse eID="John.6.34" />
<verse sID="John.6.35" osisID="John.6.35" n="35" />Jesus said to them: I am the bread of life; he that comes to me shall never hunger; he that believes on me shall never thirst.
<verse eID="John.6.35" />
<verse sID="John.6.36" osisID="John.6.36" n="36" />But I said to you, that you have seen me, and yet you do not believe.
<verse eID="John.6.36" />
<verse sID="John.6.37" osisID="John.6.37" n="37" />All that the Father gives me, will come to me; and him that comes to me, I will by no means cast out.
<verse eID="John.6.37" />
<verse sID="John.6.38" osisID="John.6.38" n="38" />For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
<verse eID="John.6.38" />
<verse sID="John.6.39" osisID="John.6.39" n="39" />And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all that he gives me, I shall lose nothing, but shall raise it up at the last day.
<verse eID="John.6.39" />
<verse sID="John.6.40" osisID="John.6.40" n="40" />For this is the will of him that sent me, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.40" />
<verse sID="John.6.41" osisID="John.6.41" n="41" />Then the Jews murmured at him, because he said, I am like bread that came down from heaven.
<verse eID="John.6.41" />
<verse sID="John.6.42" osisID="John.6.42" n="42" />And they said: Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How, then, does he say, I came down from heaven?
<verse eID="John.6.42" />
<verse sID="John.6.43" osisID="John.6.43" n="43" />Jesus answered and said to them: Murmur not among yourselves;
<verse eID="John.6.43" />
<verse sID="John.6.44" osisID="John.6.44" n="44" />no man can come to me, unless the Father, who sent me, draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.
<verse eID="John.6.44" />
<verse sID="John.6.45" osisID="John.6.45" n="45" />It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hears from the Father, and learns, comes to me.
<verse eID="John.6.45" />
<verse sID="John.6.46" osisID="John.6.46" n="46" />Not that any one has seen the Father, but he who is from God; he has seen the Father.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.46" />
<verse sID="John.6.47" osisID="John.6.47" n="47" />Verily, verily I say to you, He that believes on me has eternal life.
<verse eID="John.6.47" />
<verse sID="John.6.48" osisID="John.6.48" n="48" />I am the bread of life.
<verse eID="John.6.48" />
<verse sID="John.6.49" osisID="John.6.49" n="49" />Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.
<verse eID="John.6.49" />
<verse sID="John.6.50" osisID="John.6.50" n="50" />This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that any one may eat of it, and not die.
<verse eID="John.6.50" />
<verse sID="John.6.51" osisID="John.6.51" n="51" />I am the bread that lives, which came down from heaven. If any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.51" />
<verse sID="John.6.52" osisID="John.6.52" n="52" />The Jews, therefore, contended among themselves, saying: How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
<verse eID="John.6.52" />
<verse sID="John.6.53" osisID="John.6.53" n="53" />Then Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
<verse eID="John.6.53" />
<verse sID="John.6.54" osisID="John.6.54" n="54" />He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day;
<verse eID="John.6.54" />
<verse sID="John.6.55" osisID="John.6.55" n="55" />for my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
<verse eID="John.6.55" />
<verse sID="John.6.56" osisID="John.6.56" n="56" />He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.
<verse eID="John.6.56" />
<verse sID="John.6.57" osisID="John.6.57" n="57" />As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.
<verse eID="John.6.57" />
<verse sID="John.6.58" osisID="John.6.58" n="58" />This is the bread that came down from heaven; not as your fathers ate the manna, and died; he that eats this bread shall live forever.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.58" />
<verse sID="John.6.59" osisID="John.6.59" n="59" />These things he spoke in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
<verse eID="John.6.59" />
<verse sID="John.6.60" osisID="John.6.60" n="60" />Therefore, many of his disciples, when they heard him, said: This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
<verse eID="John.6.60" />
<verse sID="John.6.61" osisID="John.6.61" n="61" />But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them: Does this offend you?
<verse eID="John.6.61" />
<verse sID="John.6.62" osisID="John.6.62" n="62" />Then, what if you should see the Son of man go up where he was before?
<verse eID="John.6.62" />
<verse sID="John.6.63" osisID="John.6.63" n="63" />It is the spirit that makes alive; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I speak to you are spirit and life.
<verse eID="John.6.63" />
<verse sID="John.6.64" osisID="John.6.64" n="64" />But there are some among you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who he was that would betray him.
<verse eID="John.6.64" />
<verse sID="John.6.65" osisID="John.6.65" n="65" />And he said: For this reason I said to you: No one can come to me unless it be given him from my Father.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.6.65" />
<verse sID="John.6.66" osisID="John.6.66" n="66" />After this, many of his disciples went back, and walked with him no more.
<verse eID="John.6.66" />
<verse sID="John.6.67" osisID="John.6.67" n="67" />Then Jesus said to the twelve: Will you also go away?
<verse eID="John.6.67" />
<verse sID="John.6.68" osisID="John.6.68" n="68" />Simon Peter answered him: Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life;
<verse eID="John.6.68" />
<verse sID="John.6.69" osisID="John.6.69" n="69" />and we believe, and know that thou art the Christ, the Son of God.
<verse eID="John.6.69" />
<verse sID="John.6.70" osisID="John.6.70" n="70" />Jesus answered them: Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
<verse eID="John.6.70" />
<verse sID="John.6.71" osisID="John.6.71" n="71" />He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.

<p>
<chapter sID="John.7" osisID="John.7" n="7" />
<verse sID="John.7.1" osisID="John.7.1" n="1" />And after this Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.7.1" />
<verse sID="John.7.2" osisID="John.7.2" n="2" />Now the feast of tabernacles, a feast of the Jews, was near.
<verse eID="John.7.2" />
<verse sID="John.7.3" osisID="John.7.3" n="3" />Then his brothers said to him: Depart hence, and go into Judea, that your disciples may see your works which you do;
<verse eID="John.7.3" />
<verse sID="John.7.4" osisID="John.7.4" n="4" />for no one does any thing in secret, while he himself seeks to be before the public. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.
<verse eID="John.7.4" />
<verse sID="John.7.5" osisID="John.7.5" n="5" />For neither did his brothers believe on him.
<verse eID="John.7.5" />
<verse sID="John.7.6" osisID="John.7.6" n="6" />Then Jesus said to them: My time has not yet come; but your time is always ready.
<verse eID="John.7.6" />
<verse sID="John.7.7" osisID="John.7.7" n="7" />The world can not hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
<verse eID="John.7.7" />
<verse sID="John.7.8" osisID="John.7.8" n="8" />Do you go up to this feast. I go not up now to this feast, because my time has not yet fully come.
<verse eID="John.7.8" />
<verse sID="John.7.9" osisID="John.7.9" n="9" />These things said he to them, and remained in Galilee.
<verse eID="John.7.9" />
<verse sID="John.7.10" osisID="John.7.10" n="10" />But when his brothers had gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.7.10" />
<verse sID="John.7.11" osisID="John.7.11" n="11" />Then the Jews sought for him at the feast, and said: Where is he?
<verse eID="John.7.11" />
<verse sID="John.7.12" osisID="John.7.12" n="12" />And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said: He is a good man. Others said: No; but he deceives the multitude.
<verse eID="John.7.12" />
<verse sID="John.7.13" osisID="John.7.13" n="13" />However, no one spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.7.13" />
<verse sID="John.7.14" osisID="John.7.14" n="14" />Now in the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
<verse eID="John.7.14" />
<verse sID="John.7.15" osisID="John.7.15" n="15" />And the Jews were astonished, and said: How has this man a knowledge of letters, having never been taught?
<verse eID="John.7.15" />
<verse sID="John.7.16" osisID="John.7.16" n="16" />Then Jesus answered and said: My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.
<verse eID="John.7.16" />
<verse sID="John.7.17" osisID="John.7.17" n="17" />If any one will do his will, he shall know with respect to the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak of myself.
<verse eID="John.7.17" />
<verse sID="John.7.18" osisID="John.7.18" n="18" />He who speaks of himself, seeks his own glory; he who seeks the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

<verse sID="John.7.19" osisID="John.7.19" n="19" />Did not Moses give you the law? and not one of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?
<verse eID="John.7.19" />
<verse sID="John.7.20" osisID="John.7.20" n="20" />The multitude answered and said: You have a demon: who seeks to kill you?

<verse eID="John.7.20" />
<verse sID="John.7.21" osisID="John.7.21" n="21" />Jesus answered and said to them: I have done one work, and you are all astonished on account of this.

<verse sID="John.7.22" osisID="John.7.22" n="22" />Moses gave you circumcision, (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers,) and you circumcise a man on the sabbath-day.
<verse eID="John.7.22" />
<verse sID="John.7.23" osisID="John.7.23" n="23" />If a man receives circumcision on the sabbath-day, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I have restored the entire man to health on the sabbath-day?

<verse eID="John.7.31" />
<verse sID="John.7.32" osisID="John.7.32" n="32" />The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent attendants to take him.
<verse eID="John.7.32" />

<verse sID="John.7.34" osisID="John.7.34" n="34" />You will seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you can not come.
<verse eID="John.7.34" />
<verse sID="John.7.35" osisID="John.7.35" n="35" />Then the Jews said among themselves: Whither is this man about to go, that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to those who are dispersed among the Greeks, and to teach the Greeks?
<verse eID="John.7.35" />
<verse sID="John.7.36" osisID="John.7.36" n="36" />What means this saying which he uttered, You will seek me, and will not find me; and, Where I am you can not come?

<verse eID="John.7.38" />
<verse sID="John.7.39" osisID="John.7.39" n="39" />But this he spoke of the Spirit, which those who believe on him were about to receive; for the Holy Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
<verse eID="John.7.39" />
<verse sID="John.7.40" osisID="John.7.40" n="40" />Therefore, many of the multitude, when they had heard this word, said: This is, in truth, the prophet.
<verse eID="John.7.40" />
<verse sID="John.7.41" osisID="John.7.41" n="41" />Others said: This is the Christ. But others said: Does the Christ come out of Galilee?
<verse eID="John.7.41" />
<verse sID="John.7.42" osisID="John.7.42" n="42" />Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the posterity of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?
<verse eID="John.7.42" />
<verse sID="John.7.43" osisID="John.7.43" n="43" />So there was a division among the multitude because of him.
<verse eID="John.7.43" />
<verse sID="John.7.44" osisID="John.7.44" n="44" />And some of them desired to take him; but no one laid hands on him.

<verse eID="John.7.46" />
<verse sID="John.7.47" osisID="John.7.47" n="47" />Then the Pharisees answered them: Are you also deceived?

<verse eID="John.7.49" />
<verse sID="John.7.50" osisID="John.7.50" n="50" />Nicodemus said to them (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them):

<verse eID="John.8.1" />
<verse sID="John.8.2" osisID="John.8.2" n="2" />And in the morning he again entered the temple, and all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.
<verse eID="John.8.2" />
<verse sID="John.8.3" osisID="John.8.3" n="3" />And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman who had been detected in adultery; and they made her stand in the midst,
<verse eID="John.8.3" />
<verse sID="John.8.4" osisID="John.8.4" n="4" />and said to him: Teacher, this woman was detected in adultery; in the very act.
<verse eID="John.8.4" />
<verse sID="John.8.5" osisID="John.8.5" n="5" />Now Moses, in his law, commanded us, that such should be stoned; but what say you?
<verse eID="John.8.5" />
<verse sID="John.8.6" osisID="John.8.6" n="6" />This they said to tempt him, that they might bring an accusation against him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
<verse eID="John.8.6" />
<verse sID="John.8.7" osisID="John.8.7" n="7" />But as they continued to ask him, he stood up, and said to them: Let him among you who is without sin, first throw a stone at her.
<verse eID="John.8.7" />
<verse sID="John.8.8" osisID="John.8.8" n="8" />And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
<verse eID="John.8.8" />
<verse sID="John.8.9" osisID="John.8.9" n="9" />But having heard him, and being convicted by their conscience, they went out, one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
<verse eID="John.8.9" />
<verse sID="John.8.10" osisID="John.8.10" n="10" />And when Jesus stood up, and saw no one but the woman, he said to her: Woman, where are those who accused you? Has no one condemned you?
<verse eID="John.8.10" />
<verse sID="John.8.11" osisID="John.8.11" n="11" />She said: No one, sir. Jesus said to her: Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.8.11" />
<verse sID="John.8.12" osisID="John.8.12" n="12" />Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying: I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
<verse eID="John.8.12" />
<verse sID="John.8.13" osisID="John.8.13" n="13" />Then the Pharisees said to him: You testify concerning yourself; your testimony is not worthy of credit.
<verse eID="John.8.13" />
<verse sID="John.8.14" osisID="John.8.14" n="14" />Jesus answered and said to them: Though I testify concerning myself, my testimony is worthy of credit; for I know whence I came, and whither I go. But you know not whence I came, and whither I go.
<verse eID="John.8.14" />
<verse sID="John.8.15" osisID="John.8.15" n="15" />You judge according to the flesh; I judge no man.
<verse eID="John.8.15" />
<verse sID="John.8.16" osisID="John.8.16" n="16" />And yet if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.
<verse eID="John.8.16" />
<verse sID="John.8.17" osisID="John.8.17" n="17" />It is also written in your law, The testimony of two is worthy of credit.
<verse eID="John.8.17" />
<verse sID="John.8.18" osisID="John.8.18" n="18" />I am one that testify concerning myself, and the Father who sent me, testifies of me.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.8.18" />
<verse sID="John.8.19" osisID="John.8.19" n="19" />Then they said to him: Where is your Father? Jesus answered: You know neither me, nor my Father. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.
<verse eID="John.8.19" />
<verse sID="John.8.20" osisID="John.8.20" n="20" />These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.

<p>
<verse eID="John.8.20" />
<verse sID="John.8.21" osisID="John.8.21" n="21" />Then spoke Jesus to them again; I go away, and you will seek me, and in your sin you shall die; whither I go, you can not come.
<verse eID="John.8.21" />
<verse sID="John.8.22" osisID="John.8.22" n="22" />Then said the Jews: Will he kill himself, because he says, Whither I go, you can not come?
<verse eID="John.8.22" />
<verse sID="John.8.23" osisID="John.8.23" n="23" />And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.
<verse eID="John.8.23" />
<verse sID="John.8.24" osisID="John.8.24" n="24" />Therefore said I to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am, He, you shall die in your sins.
<verse eID="John.8.24" />
<verse sID="John.8.25" osisID="John.8.25" n="25" />Then they said to him: Who are you? And Jesus said to them: The same that I said to you at the beginning.
<verse eID="John.8.25" />
<verse sID="John.8.26" osisID="John.8.26" n="26" />I have many things to say, and to judge with respect to you; but he that sent me is true; and what things I have heard from him, these I speak to the world.

<verse eID="John.8.27" />
<verse sID="John.8.28" osisID="John.8.28" n="28" />Then said Jesus to them: When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things.
<verse eID="John.8.28" />
<verse sID="John.8.29" osisID="John.8.29" n="29" />And he that sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.8.29" />
<verse sID="John.8.30" osisID="John.8.30" n="30" />While he was speaking these words, many believed on him.
<verse eID="John.8.30" />
<verse sID="John.8.31" osisID="John.8.31" n="31" />Then said Jesus to those Jews that believed on him: If you continue in my word, you are my disciples indeed,
<verse eID="John.8.31" />
<verse sID="John.8.32" osisID="John.8.32" n="32" />and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
<verse eID="John.8.32" />
<verse sID="John.8.33" osisID="John.8.33" n="33" />They answered him: We are the posterity of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any one. How say you, You shall be made free?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.8.33" />
<verse sID="John.8.34" osisID="John.8.34" n="34" />Jesus answered them: Verily, verily I say to you, whoever works sin is the servant of sin.
<verse eID="John.8.34" />
<verse sID="John.8.35" osisID="John.8.35" n="35" />The servant continues not in the house forever; but the Son continues forever.
<verse eID="John.8.35" />
<verse sID="John.8.36" osisID="John.8.36" n="36" />Therefore, if the Son make you free, you shall be free indeed.
<verse eID="John.8.36" />
<verse sID="John.8.37" osisID="John.8.37" n="37" />I know that you are the posterity of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
<verse eID="John.8.37" />
<verse sID="John.8.38" osisID="John.8.38" n="38" />I speak what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have seen with your father.
<verse eID="John.8.38" />
<verse sID="John.8.39" osisID="John.8.39" n="39" />They answered and said to him: Abra ham is our father.
</p>
<p>
Jesus said to them: If you were the children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.
<verse eID="John.8.39" />
<verse sID="John.8.40" osisID="John.8.40" n="40" />But now you seek to kill me, a man that has spoken to you the truth, which I have heard from God; this Abraham did not.
<verse eID="John.8.40" />
<verse sID="John.8.41" osisID="John.8.41" n="41" />You do the works of your father. They said to him: We were not born of lewdness; we have one father, God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.8.41" />
<verse sID="John.8.42" osisID="John.8.42" n="42" />Jesus said to them: If God were your father, you would love me; for I came forth from God and have come hither; nor, indeed, did I come of myself, but he sent me.
<verse eID="John.8.42" />
<verse sID="John.8.43" osisID="John.8.43" n="43" />Why do you not know what I say? Because you can not understand my words.
<verse eID="John.8.43" />
<verse sID="John.8.44" osisID="John.8.44" n="44" />You are of your father, the devil; and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks that which is false, he speaks from what is his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.
<verse eID="John.8.44" />
<verse sID="John.8.45" osisID="John.8.45" n="45" />But because I speak the truth, you believe me not.
<verse eID="John.8.45" />
<verse sID="John.8.46" osisID="John.8.46" n="46" />Which of you convicts me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?
<verse eID="John.8.46" />
<verse sID="John.8.47" osisID="John.8.47" n="47" />He that is of God, hears God’s words. For this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.

<verse eID="John.8.47" />
<verse sID="John.8.48" osisID="John.8.48" n="48" />The Jews answered, and said to him: Do we not well say that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?
<verse eID="John.8.48" />
<verse sID="John.8.49" osisID="John.8.49" n="49" />Jesus answered: I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
<verse eID="John.8.49" />
<verse sID="John.8.50" osisID="John.8.50" n="50" />I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeks and judges.
<verse eID="John.8.50" />
<verse sID="John.8.51" osisID="John.8.51" n="51" />Verily, verily I say to you, if any one will keep my word, he shall never see death.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.8.51" />
<verse sID="John.8.52" osisID="John.8.52" n="52" />Then said the Jews to him: Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
<verse eID="John.8.52" />
<verse sID="John.8.53" osisID="John.8.53" n="53" />Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead; whom do you make yourself?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.8.53" />
<verse sID="John.8.54" osisID="John.8.54" n="54" />Jesus answered: If I honor myself, my honor is nothing; it is my Father that honors me, of whom you say, that he is your God.
<verse eID="John.8.54" />
<verse sID="John.8.55" osisID="John.8.55" n="55" />And yet you have not known him. But I know him; and if I should say that I do not know him, I should be like yourselves, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word.
<verse eID="John.8.55" />
<verse sID="John.8.56" osisID="John.8.56" n="56" />Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he could see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
<verse eID="John.8.56" />
<verse sID="John.8.57" osisID="John.8.57" n="57" />Then the Jews said to him: You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.8.57" />
<verse sID="John.8.58" osisID="John.8.58" n="58" />Jesus said to them: Verily, verily I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I was.
<verse eID="John.8.58" />
<verse sID="John.8.59" osisID="John.8.59" n="59" />Then they took up stones to throw at him. But Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them; and so passed by.

<verse eID="John.9.2" />
<verse sID="John.9.3" osisID="John.9.3" n="3" />Jesus answered: Neither this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God might be made manifest in him.
<verse eID="John.9.3" />
<verse sID="John.9.4" osisID="John.9.4" n="4" />I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day; the night comes, when no man can work.

<p>
<verse eID="John.9.7" />
<verse sID="John.9.8" osisID="John.9.8" n="8" />Then his neighbors, and those who had before seen him, that he was blind, said: Is not this he that sat and begged?

<verse sID="John.9.16" osisID="John.9.16" n="16" />Then some of the Pharisees said: This man is not from God, for he keeps not the sabbath. Others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.9.16" />
<verse sID="John.9.17" osisID="John.9.17" n="17" />Again they said to the blind man: What say you of him, seeing that he opened your eyes? He said: He is a prophet.
<verse eID="John.9.17" />
<verse sID="John.9.18" osisID="John.9.18" n="18" />The Jews did not, therefore, believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, till they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
<verse eID="John.9.18" />
<verse sID="John.9.19" osisID="John.9.19" n="19" />and asked them, saying: Is this your son, who, you say, was born blind? How, then, does he now see?
<verse eID="John.9.19" />
<verse sID="John.9.20" osisID="John.9.20" n="20" />His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
<verse eID="John.9.20" />
<verse sID="John.9.21" osisID="John.9.21" n="21" />but how he now sees we know not; or who opened his eyes we know not. He is of age; ask him; he will speak for himself.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.9.21" />
<verse sID="John.9.22" osisID="John.9.22" n="22" />His parents said this, because they feared the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed, that if any one should confess him to be the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
<verse eID="John.9.22" />
<verse sID="John.9.23" osisID="John.9.23" n="23" />For this reason his parents said: He is of age; ask him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.9.23" />
<verse sID="John.9.24" osisID="John.9.24" n="24" />Then, the second time, they called the man who had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.
<verse eID="John.9.24" />
<verse sID="John.9.25" osisID="John.9.25" n="25" />He answered and said: If he is a sinner, I know it not. One thing I do know, that having been blind, I now see.
<verse eID="John.9.25" />
<verse sID="John.9.26" osisID="John.9.26" n="26" />They said to him again: What did he for you? How did he open your eyes?
<verse eID="John.9.26" />
<verse sID="John.9.27" osisID="John.9.27" n="27" />He answered them: I have already told you, and you did not understand; why would you hear it again? Do you also wish to become his disciples?
<verse eID="John.9.27" />
<verse sID="John.9.28" osisID="John.9.28" n="28" />They reviled him, and said: You are the disciple of that man; but we are the disciples of Moses.
<verse eID="John.9.28" />
<verse sID="John.9.29" osisID="John.9.29" n="29" />We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this man, we know not whence he is.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.9.29" />
<verse sID="John.9.30" osisID="John.9.30" n="30" />The man answered and said to them: Why, there is some thing wonderful in this, that you know not whence he is, and yet he has opened my eyes.
<verse eID="John.9.30" />
<verse sID="John.9.31" osisID="John.9.31" n="31" />We know that God hears not sinners; but if any one be a worshiper of God, and do his will, him he hears.
<verse eID="John.9.31" />
<verse sID="John.9.32" osisID="John.9.32" n="32" />Since the beginning it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one who had been born blind.
<verse eID="John.9.32" />
<verse sID="John.9.33" osisID="John.9.33" n="33" />If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
<verse eID="John.9.33" />
<verse sID="John.9.34" osisID="John.9.34" n="34" />They answered and said to him: You were wholly born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.9.34" />
<verse sID="John.9.35" osisID="John.9.35" n="35" />Jesus heard that they had cast him out. And having found him, he said to him: Do you believe on the Son of God?
<verse eID="John.9.35" />
<verse sID="John.9.36" osisID="John.9.36" n="36" />He answered and said: Who is he, sir, that I may believe on him?
<verse eID="John.9.36" />
<verse sID="John.9.37" osisID="John.9.37" n="37" />Jesus said to him: You have seen him; and it is he that talks with you.
<verse eID="John.9.37" />
<verse sID="John.9.38" osisID="John.9.38" n="38" />He said: Lord, I believe; and he worshiped him.
<verse eID="John.9.38" />
<verse sID="John.9.39" osisID="John.9.39" n="39" />And Jesus said: For judgment have I come into this world, that those who see not, may see; and that those who see, may become blind.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.9.39" />
<verse sID="John.9.40" osisID="John.9.40" n="40" />And some of the Pharisees who were with him, heard these things, and said to him: Are we also blind?
<verse eID="John.9.40" />
<verse sID="John.9.41" osisID="John.9.41" n="41" />Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you would not have sin; but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.

<verse eID="John.10.1" />
<verse sID="John.10.2" osisID="John.10.2" n="2" />But he that enters through the door, is the shepherd of the sheep.

<verse sID="John.10.3" osisID="John.10.3" n="3" />To him the door-keeper opens; and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
<verse eID="John.10.3" />
<verse sID="John.10.4" osisID="John.10.4" n="4" />And when he puts his own sheep out, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him; for they know his voice.

<verse eID="John.10.6" />
<verse sID="John.10.7" osisID="John.10.7" n="7" />Therefore Jesus spoke again to them: Verily, verily I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
<verse eID="John.10.7" />
<verse sID="John.10.8" osisID="John.10.8" n="8" />All that came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.
<verse eID="John.10.8" />
<verse sID="John.10.9" osisID="John.10.9" n="9" />I am the door: if any one enters through me, he shall be saved; and he shall go in and out, and find pasture.
<verse eID="John.10.9" />
<verse sID="John.10.10" osisID="John.10.10" n="10" />The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in abundance.
<verse eID="John.10.10" />
<verse sID="John.10.11" osisID="John.10.11" n="11" />I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
<verse eID="John.10.11" />
<verse sID="John.10.12" osisID="John.10.12" n="12" />But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, to whom the sheep do not belong, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep, and scatters them.
<verse eID="John.10.12" />
<verse sID="John.10.13" osisID="John.10.13" n="13" />The hireling flees because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep.

<verse sID="John.10.15" osisID="John.10.15" n="15" />As the Father knows me, I also know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.
<verse eID="John.10.15" />
<verse sID="John.10.16" osisID="John.10.16" n="16" />And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; those, also, must I bring, and they will hear my voice: and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.
<verse eID="John.10.16" />
<verse sID="John.10.17" osisID="John.10.17" n="17" />For this reason, my Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.
<verse eID="John.10.17" />
<verse sID="John.10.18" osisID="John.10.18" n="18" />No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I have received from my Father.

<verse eID="John.10.18" />
<verse sID="John.10.19" osisID="John.10.19" n="19" />Again, therefore, there was a division among the Jews, on account of these words.
<verse eID="John.10.19" />
<verse sID="John.10.20" osisID="John.10.20" n="20" />And many of them said: He has a demon, and is mad; why do you hear him?
<verse eID="John.10.20" />
<verse sID="John.10.21" osisID="John.10.21" n="21" />Others said: These are not the words of one that has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.10.21" />
<verse sID="John.10.22" osisID="John.10.22" n="22" />And the feast of the dedication was celebrated in Jerusalem, and it was winter:
<verse eID="John.10.22" />
<verse sID="John.10.23" osisID="John.10.23" n="23" />and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.

<p>
<verse eID="John.10.23" />
<verse sID="John.10.24" osisID="John.10.24" n="24" />Then the Jews came round him, and said to him: How long do you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.
<verse eID="John.10.24" />
<verse sID="John.10.25" osisID="John.10.25" n="25" />Jesus answered them: I have told you, and you do not believe. The works which I do in my Father’s name, these testify of me.
<verse eID="John.10.25" />
<verse sID="John.10.26" osisID="John.10.26" n="26" />But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep. As I said to you,

<verse sID="John.10.28" osisID="John.10.28" n="28" />and I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall take them out of my hand.

<verse eID="John.10.31" />
<verse sID="John.10.32" osisID="John.10.32" n="32" />Jesus answered them: Many good works have I showed you from my Father: for which of these works do you stone me?
<verse eID="John.10.32" />
<verse sID="John.10.33" osisID="John.10.33" n="33" />The Jews answered and said to him: We do not stone you for a good work, but for your impious words; and because you, being man, make yourself God.
<verse eID="John.10.33" />
<verse sID="John.10.34" osisID="John.10.34" n="34" />Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?
<verse eID="John.10.34" />
<verse sID="John.10.35" osisID="John.10.35" n="35" />If he called them gods, to whom the word of God was committed, (and the scripture can not be made void,)
<verse eID="John.10.35" />
<verse sID="John.10.36" osisID="John.10.36" n="36" />do you say of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You speak impiously, because I said, I am the Son of God?

<verse eID="John.11.1" />
<verse sID="John.11.2" osisID="John.11.2" n="2" />It was the Mary that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
<verse eID="John.11.2" />
<verse sID="John.11.3" osisID="John.11.3" n="3" />Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.11.3" />
<verse sID="John.11.4" osisID="John.11.4" n="4" />But when Jesus heard it, he said: This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that by it the Son of God may be glorified.
<verse eID="John.11.4" />
<verse sID="John.11.5" osisID="John.11.5" n="5" />Now, Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

<verse sID="John.11.6" osisID="John.11.6" n="6" />When, therefore, he heard that he was sick, he still remained two days in the place where he was.
<verse eID="John.11.6" />
<verse sID="John.11.7" osisID="John.11.7" n="7" />Then after this, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.
<verse eID="John.11.7" />
<verse sID="John.11.8" osisID="John.11.8" n="8" />His disciples said to him: Rabbi, the Jews just now sought to stone thee, and art thou going thither again?
<verse eID="John.11.8" />
<verse sID="John.11.9" osisID="John.11.9" n="9" />Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks during the day, he does not stumble, for he sees the light of this world.
<verse eID="John.11.9" />
<verse sID="John.11.10" osisID="John.11.10" n="10" />But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.

<p>
<verse eID="John.11.10" />
<verse sID="John.11.11" osisID="John.11.11" n="11" />Thus spoke he; and after this he said to them: Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
<verse eID="John.11.11" />
<verse sID="John.11.12" osisID="John.11.12" n="12" />Then his disciples said: Lord, if he sleeps, he will be saved.

<verse sID="John.11.26" osisID="John.11.26" n="26" />and he that lives and believes on me, shall never die. Do you believe this?

<verse sID="John.11.41" osisID="John.11.41" n="41" />Then they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said: Father, I thank thee, that thou hast heard me.
<verse eID="John.11.41" />
<verse sID="John.11.42" osisID="John.11.42" n="42" />I know, in deed, that thou dost always hear me. But for the sake of the multitude who stand around me, I have said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
<verse eID="John.11.42" />
<verse sID="John.11.43" osisID="John.11.43" n="43" />And when he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
<verse eID="John.11.43" />
<verse sID="John.11.44" osisID="John.11.44" n="44" />And he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound around with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.11.44" />
<verse sID="John.11.45" osisID="John.11.45" n="45" />Then many of the Jews that had come to Mary, and who saw what he had done, believed on him.
<verse eID="John.11.45" />
<verse sID="John.11.46" osisID="John.11.46" n="46" />But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.11.46" />
<verse sID="John.11.47" osisID="John.11.47" n="47" />Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin, and said: What are we doing? For this man does many signs.
<verse eID="John.11.47" />
<verse sID="John.11.48" osisID="John.11.48" n="48" />If we thus let him alone, all will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away our place and our nation.
<verse eID="John.11.48" />
<verse sID="John.11.49" osisID="John.11.49" n="49" />But one of them, Caiaphas, who was chief priest that year, said to them: You know nothing,
<verse eID="John.11.49" />
<verse sID="John.11.50" osisID="John.11.50" n="50" />nor do you consider that it is profitable for us, that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.
<verse eID="John.11.50" />
<verse sID="John.11.51" osisID="John.11.51" n="51" />But this he did not speak of himself; but being chief priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation;
<verse eID="John.11.51" />
<verse sID="John.11.52" osisID="John.11.52" n="52" />and not for the nation only, but that he should gather into one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
<verse eID="John.11.52" />
<verse sID="John.11.53" osisID="John.11.53" n="53" />From that day, therefore, they consulted together to put him to death.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.11.53" />
<verse sID="John.11.54" osisID="John.11.54" n="54" />Therefore, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but withdrew thence to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he remained with his disciples.
<verse eID="John.11.54" />
<verse sID="John.11.55" osisID="John.11.55" n="55" />And the passover of the Jews was near; and many went up from the country to Jerusalem, before the passover, to purify themselves.
<verse eID="John.11.55" />
<verse sID="John.11.56" osisID="John.11.56" n="56" />Then they sought for Jesus, and said one to another, as they stood in the temple: What think you, that he will not come to the feast?
<verse eID="John.11.56" />
<verse sID="John.11.57" osisID="John.11.57" n="57" />Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders, that, if any one knew where he was, he should inform them, that they might take him.

<verse sID="John.12.1" osisID="John.12.1" n="1" />Then, six days before the passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he had raised from the dead.
<verse eID="John.12.1" />
<verse sID="John.12.2" osisID="John.12.2" n="2" />There they made him a supper, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who reclined at table with him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.12.2" />
<verse sID="John.12.3" osisID="John.12.3" n="3" />Then Mary took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the perfume of the ointment.
<verse eID="John.12.3" />
<verse sID="John.12.4" osisID="John.12.4" n="4" />Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, who was about to deliver him up:
<verse eID="John.12.4" />
<verse sID="John.12.5" osisID="John.12.5" n="5" />Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?
<verse eID="John.12.5" />
<verse sID="John.12.6" osisID="John.12.6" n="6" />But he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and took what was put in it.
<verse eID="John.12.6" />
<verse sID="John.12.7" osisID="John.12.7" n="7" />Then Jesus said: Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of my burial.
<verse eID="John.12.7" />
<verse sID="John.12.8" osisID="John.12.8" n="8" />For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.12.8" />
<verse sID="John.12.9" osisID="John.12.9" n="9" />Therefore, a great multitude of the Jews learned that he was there; and they came, not on account of Jesus only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
<verse eID="John.12.9" />
<verse sID="John.12.10" osisID="John.12.10" n="10" />But the chief priests consulted that they might kill Lazarus also,
<verse eID="John.12.10" />
<verse sID="John.12.11" osisID="John.12.11" n="11" />because on account of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.12.11" />
<verse sID="John.12.12" osisID="John.12.12" n="12" />On the next day, a great multitude that had come to the feast, having heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,
<verse eID="John.12.12" />
<verse sID="John.12.13" osisID="John.12.13" n="13" />took branches of palm-trees, and went out to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is the king of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.
<verse eID="John.12.13" />
<verse sID="John.12.14" osisID="John.12.14" n="14" />And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon him, as it is written:
<verse eID="John.12.14" />
<verse sID="John.12.15" osisID="John.12.15" n="15" />Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king comes, sitting on the colt of an ass.
<verse eID="John.12.15" />
<verse sID="John.12.16" osisID="John.12.16" n="16" />His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.12.16" />
<verse sID="John.12.17" osisID="John.12.17" n="17" />The multitude therefore that was with him, testified that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.
<verse eID="John.12.17" />
<verse sID="John.12.18" osisID="John.12.18" n="18" />For this reason, also, the multitude met him, because they had heard that he had done this sign.
<verse eID="John.12.18" />
<verse sID="John.12.19" osisID="John.12.19" n="19" />Then the Pharisees said among themselves: You see that you gain nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.

<verse sID="John.12.20" osisID="John.12.20" n="20" />Among those who came to worship at the feast were certain Greeks.

<verse sID="John.12.21" osisID="John.12.21" n="21" />These then came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying: Sir, we wish to see Jesus.
<verse eID="John.12.21" />
<verse sID="John.12.22" osisID="John.12.22" n="22" />Philip came and told Andrew; and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
<verse eID="John.12.22" />
<verse sID="John.12.23" osisID="John.12.23" n="23" />But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour has come that the Son of man must be glorified.

<verse sID="John.12.24" osisID="John.12.24" n="24" />Verily, verily I say to you, unless a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains alone; but if it die, it produces much fruit.

<verse sID="John.12.27" osisID="John.12.27" n="27" />Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But for this purpose came I to this hour.
<verse eID="John.12.27" />
<verse sID="John.12.28" osisID="John.12.28" n="28" />Father, glorify thy name. Then there came a voice from heaven: I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.
<verse eID="John.12.28" />
<verse sID="John.12.29" osisID="John.12.29" n="29" />Then the multitude that stood by and heard it, said: It thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.
<verse eID="John.12.29" />
<verse sID="John.12.30" osisID="John.12.30" n="30" />Jesus answered and said: This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.
<verse eID="John.12.30" />
<verse sID="John.12.31" osisID="John.12.31" n="31" />Now is the judgment of this world: now is the prince of this world cast out.

<verse eID="John.12.32" />
<verse sID="John.12.33" osisID="John.12.33" n="33" />This he said, signifying what death he was about to die.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.12.33" />
<verse sID="John.12.34" osisID="John.12.34" n="34" />The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that the Christ remains forever: and how say you that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
<verse eID="John.12.34" />
<verse sID="John.12.35" osisID="John.12.35" n="35" />Then Jesus said to them: Yet a little while is the light with you: walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you. For he that walks in the darkness knows not whither he goes.
<verse eID="John.12.35" />
<verse sID="John.12.36" osisID="John.12.36" n="36" />While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become the sons of light. These things spoke Jesus, and he departed, and concealed himself from them.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.12.36" />
<verse sID="John.12.37" osisID="John.12.37" n="37" />But though he had done so many signs in their presence, yet they believed not on him,
<verse eID="John.12.37" />
<verse sID="John.12.38" osisID="John.12.38" n="38" />that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
<verse eID="John.12.38" />
<verse sID="John.12.39" osisID="John.12.39" n="39" />For this reason they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:
<verse eID="John.12.39" />
<verse sID="John.12.40" osisID="John.12.40" n="40" />He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and should turn, and I should give them health.
<verse eID="John.12.40" />
<verse sID="John.12.41" osisID="John.12.41" n="41" />These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
<verse eID="John.12.41" />
<verse sID="John.12.42" osisID="John.12.42" n="42" />But yet, many even of the rulers believed on him; but on account of the Pharisees, they would not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;
<verse eID="John.12.42" />
<verse sID="John.12.43" osisID="John.12.43" n="43" />for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.12.43" />
<verse sID="John.12.44" osisID="John.12.44" n="44" />Jesus cried, and said: He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.
<verse eID="John.12.44" />
<verse sID="John.12.45" osisID="John.12.45" n="45" />And he that sees me, sees him that sent me.

<verse sID="John.12.46" osisID="John.12.46" n="46" />I have come a light into the world, that he who believes on me, may not remain in darkness.
<verse eID="John.12.46" />
<verse sID="John.12.47" osisID="John.12.47" n="47" />And if any one hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
<verse eID="John.12.47" />
<verse sID="John.12.48" osisID="John.12.48" n="48" />He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has that which judges him: the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day.
<verse eID="John.12.48" />
<verse sID="John.12.49" osisID="John.12.49" n="49" />For I have not spoken of myself: but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.
<verse eID="John.12.49" />
<verse sID="John.12.50" osisID="John.12.50" n="50" />And I know that his commandment is life eternal. What things I speak therefore, as the Father has said to me, so I speak.

<verse sID="John.13.2" osisID="John.13.2" n="2" />And supper being over, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to deliver him up,

<verse eID="John.13.10" />
<verse sID="John.13.11" osisID="John.13.11" n="11" />For he knew who would deliver him up; for this reason he said, You are not all clean.

<verse sID="John.13.12" osisID="John.13.12" n="12" />Therefore, when he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, he reclined at table again, and said to them: Do you understand what I have done for you?

<verse sID="John.13.29" osisID="John.13.29" n="29" />For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy what we need for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.

<verse sID="John.18.1" osisID="John.18.1" n="1" />When Jesus had spoken these things, he went out with his disciples beyond the brook Kedron, where was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.
<verse eID="John.18.1" />
<verse sID="John.18.2" osisID="John.18.2" n="2" />And Judas, who delivered him up, also knew the place, because Jesus often went thither with his disciples.
<verse eID="John.18.2" />
<verse sID="John.18.3" osisID="John.18.3" n="3" />Judas, then, having received the band of soldiers and attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees, came thither with torches and lamps and weapons.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.18.3" />
<verse sID="John.18.4" osisID="John.18.4" n="4" />Then Jesus, knowing all things that were coming upon him, went forth, and said to them: Whom do you seek?
<verse eID="John.18.4" />
<verse sID="John.18.5" osisID="John.18.5" n="5" />They answered him: Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said to them: I am he. Judas, also, who delivered him up, was standing among them.
<verse eID="John.18.5" />
<verse sID="John.18.6" osisID="John.18.6" n="6" />Then, when he said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
<verse eID="John.18.6" />
<verse sID="John.18.7" osisID="John.18.7" n="7" />Then he asked them again: Whom do you seek? They said: Jesus the Nazarene.
<verse eID="John.18.7" />
<verse sID="John.18.8" osisID="John.18.8" n="8" />Jesus answered: I have told you that I am he. If, then, you seek me, let these go away.

<p>
<verse eID="John.18.9" />
<verse sID="John.18.10" osisID="John.18.10" n="10" />Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the chief priest, and cut off his right ear. The name of the servant was Malchus.
<verse eID="John.18.10" />
<verse sID="John.18.11" osisID="John.18.11" n="11" />Then Jesus said to Peter: Put up your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup that my Father has given me?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.18.11" />
<verse sID="John.18.12" osisID="John.18.12" n="12" />Then the band of soldiers, and the officer, and the attendants of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him,
<verse eID="John.18.12" />
<verse sID="John.18.13" osisID="John.18.13" n="13" />and led him first to Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was chief priest that year.
<verse eID="John.18.13" />
<verse sID="John.18.14" osisID="John.18.14" n="14" />It was Caiaphas who had given counsel to the Jews, that it was profitable that one man should die for the people.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.18.14" />
<verse sID="John.18.15" osisID="John.18.15" n="15" />And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. And that other disciple was acquainted with the chief priest, and he went in with Jesus into the palace of the chief priest.
<verse eID="John.18.15" />
<verse sID="John.18.16" osisID="John.18.16" n="16" />But Peter stood without near the door. Then the other disciple, who was acquainted with the chief priest, went out and spoke to the door-keeper, and brought Peter in.
<verse eID="John.18.16" />
<verse sID="John.18.17" osisID="John.18.17" n="17" />Then the maid-servant who kept the door said to Peter: Are you not also one of the disciples of this man? He said: I am not.
<verse eID="John.18.17" />
<verse sID="John.18.18" osisID="John.18.18" n="18" />And the servants and the attendants, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, were standing and warming themselves. And Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.18.18" />
<verse sID="John.18.19" osisID="John.18.19" n="19" />Then the chief priest questioned Jesus concerning his disciples and his teaching.
<verse eID="John.18.19" />
<verse sID="John.18.20" osisID="John.18.20" n="20" />Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews come together, and in secret I have spoken nothing.
<verse eID="John.18.20" />
<verse sID="John.18.21" osisID="John.18.21" n="21" />Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard, what things I said to them. Behold, they know what I have said.
<verse eID="John.18.21" />
<verse sID="John.18.22" osisID="John.18.22" n="22" />When he had spoken thus, one of the attendants, who was standing by, struck Jesus with his open hand, saying: Do you answer the chief priest thus?
<verse eID="John.18.22" />
<verse sID="John.18.23" osisID="John.18.23" n="23" />Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you strike me?
<verse eID="John.18.23" />
<verse sID="John.18.24" osisID="John.18.24" n="24" />Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.18.24" />
<verse sID="John.18.25" osisID="John.18.25" n="25" />And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him: Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied, and said: I am not.
<verse eID="John.18.25" />
<verse sID="John.18.26" osisID="John.18.26" n="26" />One of the servants of the chief priest, who was a kinsman of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said: Did I not see you in the garden with him?
<verse eID="John.18.26" />
<verse sID="John.18.27" osisID="John.18.27" n="27" />Then Peter denied again. And immediately the cock crew.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.18.27" />
<verse sID="John.18.28" osisID="John.18.28" n="28" />Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s palace. It was the morning hour. And, in order that they might not be denied, but that they might eat the passover, they did not go into the governor’s palace.
<verse eID="John.18.28" />
<verse sID="John.18.29" osisID="John.18.29" n="29" />Then Pilate came out to them, and said: What accusation do you bring against this man?
<verse eID="John.18.29" />
<verse sID="John.18.30" osisID="John.18.30" n="30" />They answered and said to him: If this man were not an evil-doer, we would not have delivered him to you.
<verse eID="John.18.30" />
<verse sID="John.18.31" osisID="John.18.31" n="31" />Then Pilate said to them: Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. Then the Jews said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any one to death;
<verse eID="John.18.31" />
<verse sID="John.18.32" osisID="John.18.32" n="32" />that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what death he was about to die.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.18.32" />
<verse sID="John.18.33" osisID="John.18.33" n="33" />Then Pilate again entered the governor’s palace, and called Jesus, and said to him: Are you the king of the Jews?
<verse eID="John.18.33" />
<verse sID="John.18.34" osisID="John.18.34" n="34" />Jesus answered him: Do you say this of yourself, or did others speak to you of me?
<verse eID="John.18.34" />
<verse sID="John.18.35" osisID="John.18.35" n="35" />Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Your own nation, and the chief priests have delivered you to me; what have you done?
<verse eID="John.18.35" />
<verse sID="John.18.36" osisID="John.18.36" n="36" />Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I might not be delivered up to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not hence.
<verse eID="John.18.36" />
<verse sID="John.18.37" osisID="John.18.37" n="37" />Then Pilate said to him: You are a king, then? Jesus answered; You say that I am a king. For this purpose was I born, and for this purpose I came into the world, that I might testify to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, hears my voice.
<verse eID="John.18.37" />
<verse sID="John.18.38" osisID="John.18.38" n="38" />Pilate said to him: What is truth?
</p>
<p>
And when he had said this, he again came out to the Jews, and said to them: I find no fault in him.
<verse eID="John.18.38" />
<verse sID="John.18.39" osisID="John.18.39" n="39" />But you have a custom, that I release to you one during the passover. Are you willing, then, that I should release to you the king of the Jews?
<verse eID="John.18.39" />
<verse sID="John.18.40" osisID="John.18.40" n="40" />They all, then, cried out, saying: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.

<chapter sID="John.19" osisID="John.19" n="19" />
<verse sID="John.19.1" osisID="John.19.1" n="1" />Then Pilate, therefore, took Jesus and scourged him.
<verse eID="John.19.1" />
<verse sID="John.19.2" osisID="John.19.2" n="2" />And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorn-branches, and put it upon his head; and they put on him a purple robe,
<verse eID="John.19.2" />
<verse sID="John.19.3" osisID="John.19.3" n="3" />and said: Hail, King of the Jews. And they struck him with their open hands.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.19.3" />
<verse sID="John.19.4" osisID="John.19.4" n="4" />Then Pilate came out again, and said to them: Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.
<verse eID="John.19.4" />
<verse sID="John.19.5" osisID="John.19.5" n="5" />Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorn branches, and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them: Be hold the man!
<verse eID="John.19.5" />
<verse sID="John.19.6" osisID="John.19.6" n="6" />When the chief priests and their attendants saw him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said to them: Do you take him and crucify him; for I find no fault in him.
<verse eID="John.19.6" />
<verse sID="John.19.7" osisID="John.19.7" n="7" />The Jews answered: We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.19.7" />
<verse sID="John.19.8" osisID="John.19.8" n="8" />Then, when Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid;
<verse eID="John.19.8" />
<verse sID="John.19.9" osisID="John.19.9" n="9" />and he went into the governor’s palace again, and said to Jesus: Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.
<verse eID="John.19.9" />
<verse sID="John.19.10" osisID="John.19.10" n="10" />Then Pilate said to him: Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify you, and authority to release you?
<verse eID="John.19.10" />
<verse sID="John.19.11" osisID="John.19.11" n="11" />Jesus answered: You could have no authority over me, had it not been given you from above. Therefore, he that delivered me to you, has the greater sin.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.19.11" />
<verse sID="John.19.12" osisID="John.19.12" n="12" />After this Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If you release this man, you are not Cæsar’s friend. Every one that makes himself a king, speaks against Cæsar
<verse eID="John.19.12" />
<verse sID="John.19.13" osisID="John.19.13" n="13" />Then Pilate, when he heard that word, led Jesus out, and sat on the judgment-seat, in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha;
<verse eID="John.19.13" />
<verse sID="John.19.14" osisID="John.19.14" n="14" />it was the preparation for the passover, and about the third hour; and he said to the Jews, Behold your king!
<verse eID="John.19.14" />
<verse sID="John.19.15" osisID="John.19.15" n="15" />But they cried out: Away with him, away with him; crucify him! Pilate said to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Cæsar
<verse eID="John.19.15" />
<verse sID="John.19.16" osisID="John.19.16" n="16" />Then he, therefore, delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.19.16" />
<verse sID="John.19.17" osisID="John.19.17" n="17" />And, bearing his cross, he went forth into a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called, in Hebrew, Golgotha,
<verse eID="John.19.17" />
<verse sID="John.19.18" osisID="John.19.18" n="18" />where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.

<verse eID="John.19.18" />
<verse sID="John.19.19" osisID="John.19.19" n="19" />And Pilate wrote a superscription, and put it on the cross; and the writing was, JESUS THE NAZABENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<verse eID="John.19.19" />
<verse sID="John.19.20" osisID="John.19.20" n="20" />Therefore many of the Jews read this superscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew and in Greek and in Latin.
<verse eID="John.19.20" />
<verse sID="John.19.21" osisID="John.19.21" n="21" />Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not, The king of the Jews; but, that he said, I am the king of the Jews.
<verse eID="John.19.21" />
<verse sID="John.19.22" osisID="John.19.22" n="22" />Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.
<verse eID="John.19.22" />
<verse sID="John.19.23" osisID="John.19.23" n="23" />Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing, and made four parts, to each soldier a part; and they took his coat also. Now his coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
<verse eID="John.19.23" />
<verse sID="John.19.24" osisID="John.19.24" n="24" />Then they said, one to another, let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be. <transChange type="added">This was done</transChange> that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says: They divided my clothing among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots.

<verse eID="John.19.24" />
<verse sID="John.19.25" osisID="John.19.25" n="25" />Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
<verse eID="John.19.25" />
<verse sID="John.19.26" osisID="John.19.26" n="26" />Then Jesus, seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by, said to his mother: Woman, behold your son.
<verse eID="John.19.26" />
<verse sID="John.19.27" osisID="John.19.27" n="27" />Then he said to the disciple: Behold your mother. And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.19.27" />
<verse sID="John.19.28" osisID="John.19.28" n="28" />After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.
<verse eID="John.19.28" />
<verse sID="John.19.29" osisID="John.19.29" n="29" />Now a vessel full of vinegar had been set there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon a hyssop-stalk, and put it to his mouth.
<verse eID="John.19.29" />
<verse sID="John.19.30" osisID="John.19.30" n="30" />Therefore, when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said: It is finished. And he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.19.30" />
<verse sID="John.19.31" osisID="John.19.31" n="31" />Then the Jews, as it was the preparation, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for that sabbath-day was a great day, besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken down.
<verse eID="John.19.31" />
<verse sID="John.19.32" osisID="John.19.32" n="32" />Then came the soldiers and broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him.
<verse eID="John.19.32" />
<verse sID="John.19.33" osisID="John.19.33" n="33" />But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs:
<verse eID="John.19.33" />
<verse sID="John.19.34" osisID="John.19.34" n="34" />but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear; and immediately there came out blood and water.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.19.34" />
<verse sID="John.19.35" osisID="John.19.35" n="35" />And he that saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he speaks the truth, that you may believe;
<verse eID="John.19.35" />
<verse sID="John.19.36" osisID="John.19.36" n="36" />for these things were done that the scripture might be fulfilled: A bone of him shall not be broken.
<verse eID="John.19.36" />
<verse sID="John.19.37" osisID="John.19.37" n="37" />And again another scripture says: They shall look on him whom they pierced.

<verse sID="John.19.38" osisID="John.19.38" n="38" />And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him permission. He then came and took away the body of Jesus.
<verse eID="John.19.38" />
<verse sID="John.19.39" osisID="John.19.39" n="39" />Then came Nicodemus also, (who, at the first, had come to Jesus by night,) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
<verse eID="John.19.39" />
<verse sID="John.19.40" osisID="John.19.40" n="40" />Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, according to the Jewish custom of burying.
<verse eID="John.19.40" />
<verse sID="John.19.41" osisID="John.19.41" n="41" />Now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.
<verse eID="John.19.41" />
<verse sID="John.19.42" osisID="John.19.42" n="42" />There, then, on account of the preparation-day of the Jews, they laid Jesus, for the tomb was near.

<chapter sID="John.20" osisID="John.20" n="20" />
<verse sID="John.20.1" osisID="John.20.1" n="1" />And early on the first day of the week, while it was yet dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
<verse eID="John.20.1" />
<verse sID="John.20.2" osisID="John.20.2" n="2" />Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them: They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.
<verse eID="John.20.2" />
<verse sID="John.20.3" osisID="John.20.3" n="3" />Then Peter and the other disciple went out, and came to the tomb.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.20.3" />
<verse sID="John.20.4" osisID="John.20.4" n="4" />And the two ran together; and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;
<verse eID="John.20.4" />
<verse sID="John.20.5" osisID="John.20.5" n="5" />and he stooped down and saw the linen cloths lying, but he did not go in.
<verse eID="John.20.5" />
<verse sID="John.20.6" osisID="John.20.6" n="6" />Then came Simon Peter, following him; and he went into the tomb, and saw the linen cloths lying,
<verse eID="John.20.6" />
<verse sID="John.20.7" osisID="John.20.7" n="7" />and the handkerchief that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded in a place by itself.
<verse eID="John.20.7" />
<verse sID="John.20.8" osisID="John.20.8" n="8" />Then, therefore, the other disciple, who came first to the tomb, went in, and saw, and believed.
<verse eID="John.20.8" />
<verse sID="John.20.9" osisID="John.20.9" n="9" />For, as yet, they did not know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.
<verse eID="John.20.9" />
<verse sID="John.20.10" osisID="John.20.10" n="10" />Then the disciples went away again by themselves.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.20.10" />
<verse sID="John.20.11" osisID="John.20.11" n="11" />But Mary stood without near the tomb, weeping; and as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the tomb,
<verse eID="John.20.11" />
<verse sID="John.20.12" osisID="John.20.12" n="12" />and saw two angels in white raiment, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the foot, where the body of Jesus had lain.
<verse eID="John.20.12" />
<verse sID="John.20.13" osisID="John.20.13" n="13" />And they said to her: Woman, why do you weep? She said to them: They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
<verse eID="John.20.13" />
<verse sID="John.20.14" osisID="John.20.14" n="14" />Having said this, she turned back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.20.14" />
<verse sID="John.20.15" osisID="John.20.15" n="15" />Jesus said to her: Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? Supposing that it was the gardener, she said to him: Sir, if you have taken him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.
<verse eID="John.20.15" />
<verse sID="John.20.16" osisID="John.20.16" n="16" />Jesus said to her: Mary. She turned, and said to him: Rabboni; which is, translated, Teacher.
<verse eID="John.20.16" />
<verse sID="John.20.17" osisID="John.20.17" n="17" />Jesus said to her: Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.
<verse eID="John.20.17" />
<verse sID="John.20.18" osisID="John.20.18" n="18" />Mary Magdalen came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.20.18" />
<verse sID="John.20.19" osisID="John.20.19" n="19" />Then, on that day, the first day of the week, when it was evening, and the doors of the house in which the disciples were assembled had been closed for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be to you.
<verse eID="John.20.19" />
<verse sID="John.20.20" osisID="John.20.20" n="20" />And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced, when they saw the Lord.
<verse eID="John.20.20" />
<verse sID="John.20.21" osisID="John.20.21" n="21" />Then Jesus said to them again: Peace be to you. As my Father has sent me, so I send you.
<verse eID="John.20.21" />
<verse sID="John.20.22" osisID="John.20.22" n="22" />And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them: Receive the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="John.20.22" />
<verse sID="John.20.23" osisID="John.20.23" n="23" />Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them: whosever sins you retain, they are retained.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.20.23" />
<verse sID="John.20.24" osisID="John.20.24" n="24" />But Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
<verse eID="John.20.24" />
<verse sID="John.20.25" osisID="John.20.25" n="25" />Then the other disciples said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger in the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.20.25" />
<verse sID="John.20.26" osisID="John.20.26" n="26" />And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas was with them. Then Jesus came, though the doors had been closed, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you.
<verse eID="John.20.26" />
<verse sID="John.20.27" osisID="John.20.27" n="27" />Then he said to Thomas: Reach hither your finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither your hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.
<verse eID="John.20.27" />
<verse sID="John.20.28" osisID="John.20.28" n="28" />And Thomas answered and said to him: My Lord and my God.
<verse eID="John.20.28" />
<verse sID="John.20.29" osisID="John.20.29" n="29" />Jesus said to him: Because you have seen me you have believed: blessed are they who, though they have not seen, yet have believed.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.20.29" />
<verse sID="John.20.30" osisID="John.20.30" n="30" />Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;
<verse eID="John.20.30" />
<verse sID="John.20.31" osisID="John.20.31" n="31" />but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life through his name.

<chapter sID="John.21" osisID="John.21" n="21" />
<verse sID="John.21.1" osisID="John.21.1" n="1" />After this, Jesus showed himself again to his disciples, at the sea of Tiberias. And he showed himself in this way.
<verse eID="John.21.1" />
<verse sID="John.21.2" osisID="John.21.2" n="2" />There were together, Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathaniel of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.
<verse eID="John.21.2" />
<verse sID="John.21.3" osisID="John.21.3" n="3" />Simon Peter said to them: I am going a fishing. They said to him: We also are going with you. They went out and entered the ship; and that night they caught nothing.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.21.3" />
<verse sID="John.21.4" osisID="John.21.4" n="4" />But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
<verse eID="John.21.4" />
<verse sID="John.21.5" osisID="John.21.5" n="5" />Then Jesus said to them: Children, have you any food? They answered him: No.
<verse eID="John.21.5" />
<verse sID="John.21.6" osisID="John.21.6" n="6" />He said to them: Throw the net on the right side of the ship, and you will find. They threw it, there fore, and were no longer able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
<verse eID="John.21.6" />
<verse sID="John.21.7" osisID="John.21.7" n="7" />Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: It is the Lord. And when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girded on his outer coat, for he had on his inner garment only, and threw himself into the sea.
<verse eID="John.21.7" />
<verse sID="John.21.8" osisID="John.21.8" n="8" />And the other disciples came in a little ship, dragging the net with fishes, for they were not far from the land, only about two hundred cubits.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.21.8" />
<verse sID="John.21.9" osisID="John.21.9" n="9" />As soon as they had come to the land, they saw there a fire of coals, and fish lying upon it, and bread.
<verse eID="John.21.9" />
<verse sID="John.21.10" osisID="John.21.10" n="10" />Jesus said to them; Bring of the fish that you have just taken.
<verse eID="John.21.10" />
<verse sID="John.21.11" osisID="John.21.11" n="11" />Simon Peter went and drew the net to the land, full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three. And though they were so many, the net did not break.
<verse eID="John.21.11" />
<verse sID="John.21.12" osisID="John.21.12" n="12" />Jesus said to them: Come and breakfast. But no one of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? because they knew it was the Lord.
<verse eID="John.21.12" />
<verse sID="John.21.13" osisID="John.21.13" n="13" />Then Jesus came and took the bread, and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
<verse eID="John.21.13" />
<verse sID="John.21.14" osisID="John.21.14" n="14" />This was now the third occasion on which Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.21.14" />
<verse sID="John.21.15" osisID="John.21.15" n="15" />When, therefore, they had taken breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter: Simon, son of Jonah, Do you love me more than these? He said to him: Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed my lambs.
<verse eID="John.21.15" />
<verse sID="John.21.16" osisID="John.21.16" n="16" />He said to him again a second time: Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? He said to him: Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Be a shepherd to my sheep.
<verse eID="John.21.16" />
<verse sID="John.21.17" osisID="John.21.17" n="17" />He said to him a third time: Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Do you love me? And he said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said to him: Feed my sheep.
<verse eID="John.21.17" />
<verse sID="John.21.18" osisID="John.21.18" n="18" />Verily, verily I say to you, when you were young, you girded yourself, and walked whither you chose; but when you have become old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and lead you whither you would not.
<verse eID="John.21.18" />
<verse sID="John.21.19" osisID="John.21.19" n="19" />But this he said, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him: Follow me.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.21.19" />
<verse sID="John.21.20" osisID="John.21.20" n="20" />Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple that Jesus loved, following, who also reclined at supper upon his breast, and said: Lord, who is he that delivers thee up?
<verse eID="John.21.20" />
<verse sID="John.21.21" osisID="John.21.21" n="21" />Peter seeing this one, said to Jesus: Lord, what shall this one do?
<verse eID="John.21.21" />
<verse sID="John.21.22" osisID="John.21.22" n="22" />Jesus said to him: If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you? Do you follow me.
<verse eID="John.21.22" />
<verse sID="John.21.23" osisID="John.21.23" n="23" />Therefore, this saying went out among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="John.21.23" />
<verse sID="John.21.24" osisID="John.21.24" n="24" />This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.
<verse eID="John.21.24" />
<verse sID="John.21.25" osisID="John.21.25" n="25" />And there are also many other things that Jesus did; if they should be written, every one of them, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books that would be written.

<verse sID="Acts.1.1" osisID="Acts.1.1" n="1" />The former record I made, O Theophilus, of all things that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
<verse eID="Acts.1.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.2" osisID="Acts.1.2" n="2" />till the day on which he was taken up, after he had, through the Holy Spirit, given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen.
<verse eID="Acts.1.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.3" osisID="Acts.1.3" n="3" />To whom, after he had suffered, he also showed himself alive, by many indubitable proofs; appearing to them for forty days, and speaking of the things that pertain to the kingdom of God.
<verse eID="Acts.1.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.4" osisID="Acts.1.4" n="4" />And calling them together, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of my Father, which, <transChange type="added">said he,</transChange> you have heard from me;
<verse eID="Acts.1.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.5" osisID="Acts.1.5" n="5" />for John indeed immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit, not many days hence.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.1.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.6" osisID="Acts.1.6" n="6" />Therefore, when they came together, they asked him, saying: Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
<verse eID="Acts.1.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.7" osisID="Acts.1.7" n="7" />But he said to them: It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has reserved under his own control.
<verse eID="Acts.1.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.8" osisID="Acts.1.8" n="8" />But you shall receive power, after the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses for me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the most distant part of the earth.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.1.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.9" osisID="Acts.1.9" n="9" />And when he had spoken these things, while they were looking on him, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.
<verse eID="Acts.1.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.10" osisID="Acts.1.10" n="10" />And while they were looking earnestly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white raiment,
<verse eID="Acts.1.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.11" osisID="Acts.1.11" n="11" />who also said: Men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall come in the same manner in which you saw him go into heaven.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.1.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.12" osisID="Acts.1.12" n="12" />Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day’s journey.
<verse eID="Acts.1.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.13" osisID="Acts.1.13" n="13" />And when they had come in, they went up into an upper room, in which dwelt Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphæus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.
<verse eID="Acts.1.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.14" osisID="Acts.1.14" n="14" />All these, with one mind, continued in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.1.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.15" osisID="Acts.1.15" n="15" />And in those days Peter arose in the midst of the disciples, (the number of the names together was about a hundred and twenty,) and said:
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.1.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.16" osisID="Acts.1.16" n="16" />Brethren, it was necessary for this scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit had before spoken by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was a guide to those who took Jesus:
<verse eID="Acts.1.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.17" osisID="Acts.1.17" n="17" />for he was numbered with us, and had been appointed to this ministry.
<verse eID="Acts.1.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.18" osisID="Acts.1.18" n="18" />Therefore he purchased a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
<verse eID="Acts.1.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.19" osisID="Acts.1.19" n="19" />And it was known to all that dwelt in Jerusalem, so that the field is called, in their own language, Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.
<verse eID="Acts.1.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.20" osisID="Acts.1.20" n="20" />For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no one dwell in it, and, His office let another take.
<verse eID="Acts.1.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.21" osisID="Acts.1.21" n="21" />Therefore, of these men who have associated with us during the whole time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
<verse eID="Acts.1.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.22" osisID="Acts.1.22" n="22" />beginning from the immersion of John till the day on which he was taken up from us, must one be appointed as a witness with us of his resurrection.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.1.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.23" osisID="Acts.1.23" n="23" />And they set apart two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias;
<verse eID="Acts.1.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.24" osisID="Acts.1.24" n="24" />and praying, they said: Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, make known which of these two thou hast chosen,
<verse eID="Acts.1.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.25" osisID="Acts.1.25" n="25" />that he may be appointed to this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.
<verse eID="Acts.1.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.1.26" osisID="Acts.1.26" n="26" />And they gave in their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias: and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

<verse sID="Acts.2.1" osisID="Acts.2.1" n="1" />And when the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one consent in one place.
<verse eID="Acts.2.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.2" osisID="Acts.2.2" n="2" />And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of a rushing, violent wind, and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.
<verse eID="Acts.2.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.3" osisID="Acts.2.3" n="3" />And there appeared to them tongues like fire, which distributed themselves, and sat one on each of them.
<verse eID="Acts.2.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.4" osisID="Acts.2.4" n="4" />And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.2.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.5" osisID="Acts.2.5" n="5" />Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem devout Jews, from every nation under heaven.
<verse eID="Acts.2.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.6" osisID="Acts.2.6" n="6" />When the report of this had gone abroad, the multitude came together; and they were perplexed, for each one heard them speak in his own language.
<verse eID="Acts.2.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.7" osisID="Acts.2.7" n="7" />They were amazed and astonished, and said one to another: Are not all these that are speaking, Galileans?
<verse eID="Acts.2.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.8" osisID="Acts.2.8" n="8" />And how is it that we hear, every one in our own language in which we were born―
<verse eID="Acts.2.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.9" osisID="Acts.2.9" n="9" />Parthians and Modes and Elamites, and we who dwell in Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
<verse eID="Acts.2.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.10" osisID="Acts.2.10" n="10" />Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, Roman residents, Jews and proselytes,
<verse eID="Acts.2.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.11" osisID="Acts.2.11" n="11" />Cretes and Arabians―we hear them speaking, in our own tongues, the wonderful works of God?
<verse eID="Acts.2.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.12" osisID="Acts.2.12" n="12" />And they were all in amazement and doubt, and said, one to another: What can this mean?
<verse eID="Acts.2.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.13" osisID="Acts.2.13" n="13" />But others deriding, said: They are full of new wine.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.2.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.14" osisID="Acts.2.14" n="14" />But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them: Men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you, and give ear to my words.
<verse eID="Acts.2.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.15" osisID="Acts.2.15" n="15" />For these men are not drunk, as you suppose: for it is the third hour of the day.
<verse eID="Acts.2.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.16" osisID="Acts.2.16" n="16" />But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.2.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.17" osisID="Acts.2.17" n="17" />And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.

<verse sID="Acts.2.18" osisID="Acts.2.18" n="18" />And also on my servants and on my handmaids, I will pour out of my Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy.

<verse sID="Acts.2.22" osisID="Acts.2.22" n="22" />Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, clearly pointed out to you as a man from God, by mighty deeds and wonders and signs, which God did by him in your midst, as you yourselves also know,
<verse eID="Acts.2.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.23" osisID="Acts.2.23" n="23" />him, delivered up by the fixed purpose and foreknowledge of God, you took, and with wicked hands did crucify and slay:
<verse eID="Acts.2.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.24" osisID="Acts.2.24" n="24" />whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held in subjection by it.
<verse eID="Acts.2.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.25" osisID="Acts.2.25" n="25" />For David speaks with reference to him: I saw the Lord always in my presence: for he is at my right hand, that I should not be moved.
<verse eID="Acts.2.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.26" osisID="Acts.2.26" n="26" />Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue sang praise. Moreover, my flesh shall rest in hope;
<verse eID="Acts.2.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.27" osisID="Acts.2.27" n="27" />because thou wilt not leave my soul in hades, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
<verse eID="Acts.2.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.28" osisID="Acts.2.28" n="28" />Thou didst make known to me the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance.

<verse sID="Acts.2.29" osisID="Acts.2.29" n="29" />Brethren, I may say to you plainly of the patriarch David, that he died, and was buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.
<verse eID="Acts.2.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.30" osisID="Acts.2.30" n="30" />Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that he would cause one from the fruit of his loins to sit on his throne;
<verse eID="Acts.2.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.31" osisID="Acts.2.31" n="31" />foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul was not left in hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
<verse eID="Acts.2.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.32" osisID="Acts.2.32" n="32" />This Jesus has God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.
<verse eID="Acts.2.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.33" osisID="Acts.2.33" n="33" />Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from his Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.
<verse eID="Acts.2.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.34" osisID="Acts.2.34" n="34" />For David has not ascended into the heavens; but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
<verse eID="Acts.2.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.35" osisID="Acts.2.35" n="35" />till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
<verse eID="Acts.2.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.36" osisID="Acts.2.36" n="36" />Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made this same Jesus whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.2.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.37" osisID="Acts.2.37" n="37" />When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles: Brethren, what shall we do?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.2.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.38" osisID="Acts.2.38" n="38" />And Peter said to them: Repent, and be immersed, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, in order to the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Acts.2.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.39" osisID="Acts.2.39" n="39" />For the promise is to you, and your children, and to all that are afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.
<verse eID="Acts.2.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.40" osisID="Acts.2.40" n="40" />And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying: Save yourselves from this wicked generation.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.2.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.41" osisID="Acts.2.41" n="41" />Then they that gladly received his word were immersed, and on that day there were added to them about three thousand souls.
<verse eID="Acts.2.41" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.42" osisID="Acts.2.42" n="42" />And they attended constantly to the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of bread, and the prayers.
<verse eID="Acts.2.42" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.43" osisID="Acts.2.43" n="43" />And fear came on every soul; and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
<verse eID="Acts.2.43" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.44" osisID="Acts.2.44" n="44" />And all that believed were together, and had all things in common;
<verse eID="Acts.2.44" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.45" osisID="Acts.2.45" n="45" />and they sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, as each had need.
<verse eID="Acts.2.45" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.46" osisID="Acts.2.46" n="46" />And with one consent, they continued daily in the temple; and, breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,
<verse eID="Acts.2.46" />
<verse sID="Acts.2.47" osisID="Acts.2.47" n="47" />praising God, and being in favor with all the people. And the Lord added the saved daily to the Church.

<verse sID="Acts.3.2" osisID="Acts.3.2" n="2" />And a certain man, lame from his mother’s womb, was carried along, whom they laid daily at that gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, that he might ask charity of those who were going into the temple.
<verse eID="Acts.3.2" />

<verse eID="Acts.3.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.8" osisID="Acts.3.8" n="8" />And leaping up, he stood and walked, and went with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.

<verse sID="Acts.3.11" osisID="Acts.3.11" n="11" />And while he was holding to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch called Solomon’s, greatly astonished.
<verse eID="Acts.3.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.12" osisID="Acts.3.12" n="12" />But when Peter saw it, he answered the people:
</p>
<p>
Men of Israel, why are you astonished at this? or, why do you look so earnestly on us, as if by our own power or godliness we had caused this man to walk?
<verse eID="Acts.3.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.13" osisID="Acts.3.13" n="13" />The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus, whom you delivered up, and whom you rejected in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to release him.
<verse eID="Acts.3.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.14" osisID="Acts.3.14" n="14" />But you rejected the Holy and Just One, and demanded that a murderer should be given to you;

<verse sID="Acts.3.15" osisID="Acts.3.15" n="15" />and you slew the Author of life, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
<verse eID="Acts.3.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.16" osisID="Acts.3.16" n="16" />And his name, by faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you see and know; even the faith which is by him, has given him this entire soundness in the presence of you all.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.3.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.17" osisID="Acts.3.17" n="17" />And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance you did this, as did also your rulers.
<verse eID="Acts.3.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.18" osisID="Acts.3.18" n="18" />But the things which God foretold by the mouth of all his prophets, that the Christ should suffer, he has thus fulfilled.
<verse eID="Acts.3.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.19" osisID="Acts.3.19" n="19" />Repent, therefore, and turn, in order that your sins may be blotted out, so that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,

<verse eID="Acts.3.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.3.22" osisID="Acts.3.22" n="22" />For Moses said to the fathers, A prophet like me shall the Lord your God raise up for you from among your brethren; him shall you hear in all things that he shall say to you.

<verse sID="Acts.4.14" osisID="Acts.4.14" n="14" />and, seeing the man who had been cured standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.
<verse eID="Acts.4.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.15" osisID="Acts.4.15" n="15" />But, having commanded them to go aside out of the Sanhedrim, they consulted with one another,
<verse eID="Acts.4.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.16" osisID="Acts.4.16" n="16" />saying: What shall we do with these men? For that an evident sign has been done by them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem, and we can not deny it.
<verse eID="Acts.4.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.4.17" osisID="Acts.4.17" n="17" />But that it may spread no further among the people, let us severely threaten them, so that they speak no more to any man in this name.

<verse eID="Acts.5.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.14" osisID="Acts.5.14" n="14" />And believers in the Lord were more and more added to them, multitudes both of men and women;)
<verse eID="Acts.5.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.15" osisID="Acts.5.15" n="15" />so that they brought the sick out along the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that even the shadow of Peter, as he passed along, might fall on some of them.
<verse eID="Acts.5.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.16" osisID="Acts.5.16" n="16" />And many people of the cities round about came to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and those who were troubled by evil spirits, all of whom were cured.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.5.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.17" osisID="Acts.5.17" n="17" />But the chief priest arose, and all that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation;
<verse eID="Acts.5.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.18" osisID="Acts.5.18" n="18" />and they laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the public prison.
<verse eID="Acts.5.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.19" osisID="Acts.5.19" n="19" />But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison by night, and brought them out, and said:
<verse eID="Acts.5.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.20" osisID="Acts.5.20" n="20" />Go, stand in the temple, and speak to the people all the words of this life.
<verse eID="Acts.5.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.21" osisID="Acts.5.21" n="21" />And having heard this, they entered the temple, early in the morning, and taught.

</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.5.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.22" osisID="Acts.5.22" n="22" />But when the attendants came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and reported,
<verse eID="Acts.5.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.23" osisID="Acts.5.23" n="23" />saying: We found the prison closed with all safety, and the guards standing before the doors; but when we had opened, we found no one within.
<verse eID="Acts.5.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.24" osisID="Acts.5.24" n="24" />When the priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt about them, what this could mean.
<verse eID="Acts.5.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.25" osisID="Acts.5.25" n="25" />And some one came and reported to them: Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.5.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.26" osisID="Acts.5.26" n="26" />Then went the captain with the attendants, and brought them without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.
<verse eID="Acts.5.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.27" osisID="Acts.5.27" n="27" />And when they had brought them, they made them stand before the Sanhedrim; and the chief priest asked them,
<verse eID="Acts.5.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.28" osisID="Acts.5.28" n="28" />saying: Did we not strictly charge you not to teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.5.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.29" osisID="Acts.5.29" n="29" />But Peter and the apostles answered and said: We must obey God rather than men.
<verse eID="Acts.5.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.30" osisID="Acts.5.30" n="30" />The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom you slew by hanging him on a tree.

<verse sID="Acts.5.33" osisID="Acts.5.33" n="33" />And when they heard this, they were enraged; and they determined to put them to death.
<verse eID="Acts.5.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.34" osisID="Acts.5.34" n="34" />Then arose a certain man in the Sanhedrim, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people; and he commanded them to put the apostles out for a little while,
<verse eID="Acts.5.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.35" osisID="Acts.5.35" n="35" />and said to them: Men of Israel, consider well with yourselves what you are about to do to these men.
<verse eID="Acts.5.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.36" osisID="Acts.5.36" n="36" />For before these days Theudas arose, declaring himself to be some great one; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves; and he was slain; and all, as many as believed him, were scattered and brought to naught.
<verse eID="Acts.5.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.37" osisID="Acts.5.37" n="37" />After this man, Judas the Galilean arose, in the days of the enrollment, and drew over many people after him; and he was destroyed, and all, as many as believed him, were scattered.
<verse eID="Acts.5.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.38" osisID="Acts.5.38" n="38" />And now I say to you, keep away from these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to an end;
<verse eID="Acts.5.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.39" osisID="Acts.5.39" n="39" />but if it is of God, you can not bring it to an end: and take heed, lest you be found fighting also against God.

<verse sID="Acts.5.40" osisID="Acts.5.40" n="40" />And they were persuaded by him; and when they had called the apostles in and scourged them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
<verse eID="Acts.5.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.41" osisID="Acts.5.41" n="41" />Then, they went from the presence of the Sanhedrim, rejoicing that they were thought worthy to suffer shame for his name’s sake.
<verse eID="Acts.5.41" />
<verse sID="Acts.5.42" osisID="Acts.5.42" n="42" />And daily in the temple, and from house to house, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus the Christ.

<verse sID="Acts.6.5" osisID="Acts.6.5" n="5" />And the speech pleased the whole multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch,

<verse sID="Acts.6.6" osisID="Acts.6.6" n="6" />whom they set before the apostles. And when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.

<verse sID="Acts.7.3" osisID="Acts.7.3" n="3" />and said to him: Get out from your land, and from your kindred, and come into a land that I will show you.

<chapter sID="Acts.8" osisID="Acts.8" n="8" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.1" osisID="Acts.8.1" n="1" />And at that time there was a great persecution against the church that was in Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
<verse eID="Acts.8.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.2" osisID="Acts.8.2" n="2" />But devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
<verse eID="Acts.8.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.3" osisID="Acts.8.3" n="3" />But Saul attempted to destroy the church; entering every house, and dragging men and women, he delivered them up to prison.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.8.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.4" osisID="Acts.8.4" n="4" />Then they that were dispersed went everywhere preaching the word.
<verse eID="Acts.8.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.5" osisID="Acts.8.5" n="5" />And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached the Christ to them.
<verse eID="Acts.8.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.6" osisID="Acts.8.6" n="6" />And the multitudes with one mind gave heed to the things which were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.
<verse eID="Acts.8.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.7" osisID="Acts.8.7" n="7" />For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them, and many paralytics and lame persons were cured.
<verse eID="Acts.8.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.8" osisID="Acts.8.8" n="8" />And there was great joy in that city.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.8.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.9" osisID="Acts.8.9" n="9" />But there was a certain man, named Simon, who had, before this time, been practicing magic in the city, and astonishing the people of Samaria, saying that he was some great one;
<verse eID="Acts.8.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.10" osisID="Acts.8.10" n="10" />to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the great power of God.
<verse eID="Acts.8.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.11" osisID="Acts.8.11" n="11" />And they gave heed to him because he had, for a long time, astonished them with his magic arts.
<verse eID="Acts.8.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.12" osisID="Acts.8.12" n="12" />But when they believed Philip, who preached the good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were immersed, both men and women.
<verse eID="Acts.8.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.13" osisID="Acts.8.13" n="13" />And Simon himself also believed; and after he was immersed, he continued with Philip; and, seeing the mighty deeds and the signs which were done, he was astonished.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.8.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.14" osisID="Acts.8.14" n="14" />Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John;
<verse eID="Acts.8.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.15" osisID="Acts.8.15" n="15" />who, when they had gone down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Acts.8.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.16" osisID="Acts.8.16" n="16" />For he had not yet fallen on any of them; only they had been immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.8.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.17" osisID="Acts.8.17" n="17" />Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.8.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.18" osisID="Acts.8.18" n="18" />And when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money,
<verse eID="Acts.8.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.19" osisID="Acts.8.19" n="19" />saying: Give me, also, this authority, that whoever I shall lay my hands on, may receive the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Acts.8.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.20" osisID="Acts.8.20" n="20" />But Peter said to him: Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God might be purchased with money.
<verse eID="Acts.8.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.21" osisID="Acts.8.21" n="21" />You have neither part nor share in this matter; for your heart is not right in the sight of God.
<verse eID="Acts.8.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.22" osisID="Acts.8.22" n="22" />Repent, therefore, of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the purpose of your heart may be forgiven you.
<verse eID="Acts.8.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.23" osisID="Acts.8.23" n="23" />For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.
<verse eID="Acts.8.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.24" osisID="Acts.8.24" n="24" />But Simon answered and said: Pray you both to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken come upon me.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.8.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.25" osisID="Acts.8.25" n="25" />Then, when they had given their testimony, and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.8.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.26" osisID="Acts.8.26" n="26" />And an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, and go toward the south, to the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza; this is desert.
<verse eID="Acts.8.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.27" osisID="Acts.8.27" n="27" />And he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
<verse eID="Acts.8.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.28" osisID="Acts.8.28" n="28" />was returning, and, sitting in his chariot, read the prophet Isaiah.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.8.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.29" osisID="Acts.8.29" n="29" />And the Spirit said to Philip: Go forward and join yourself to this chariot.
<verse eID="Acts.8.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.30" osisID="Acts.8.30" n="30" />And Philip ran forward, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah; and he said: Do you understand what you are reading?
<verse eID="Acts.8.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.31" osisID="Acts.8.31" n="31" />He answered: How can I, unless some one instruct me? And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
<verse eID="Acts.8.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.32" osisID="Acts.8.32" n="32" />The passage of the scripture which he was reading, was this: As a sheep for the slaughter was he led; and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so opened he not his mouth
<verse eID="Acts.8.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.33" osisID="Acts.8.33" n="33" />in his humiliation. The sentence against him was taken away; but who shall describe the men of his generation? For his life was taken from the earth.
<verse eID="Acts.8.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.34" osisID="Acts.8.34" n="34" />And the eunuch answered Philip, and said: I pray you, of whom speaks the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other man?
<verse eID="Acts.8.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.35" osisID="Acts.8.35" n="35" />And Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached to him Jesus.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.8.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.36" osisID="Acts.8.36" n="36" />And as they went along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water; what hinders me from being immersed?
<verse eID="Acts.8.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.38" osisID="Acts.8.38" n="38" />And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he immersed him.
<verse eID="Acts.8.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.39" osisID="Acts.8.39" n="39" />And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.
<verse eID="Acts.8.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.8.40" osisID="Acts.8.40" n="40" />But Philip was found at Azotus, and, passing through, he preached the gospel in all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea
<verse eID="Acts.8.40" />

<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.9" osisID="Acts.9" n="9" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.1" osisID="Acts.9.1" n="1" />And Saul, still breathing out threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the chief priest,
<verse eID="Acts.9.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.2" osisID="Acts.9.2" n="2" />and asked of him letters to Damascus, for the synagogues, that, if he should find any who were of this persuasion, either men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.9.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.3" osisID="Acts.9.3" n="3" />And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus; and suddenly there shone round about him a light from heaven.
<verse eID="Acts.9.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.4" osisID="Acts.9.4" n="4" />And when he had fallen to the earth, he heard a voice saying to him: Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?
<verse eID="Acts.9.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.5" osisID="Acts.9.5" n="5" />He answered: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said: I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
<verse eID="Acts.9.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.6" osisID="Acts.9.6" n="6" />But rise, and go into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.
<verse eID="Acts.9.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.7" osisID="Acts.9.7" n="7" />The men who journeyed with him stood amazed; for they heard a voice, but saw no one.
<verse eID="Acts.9.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.8" osisID="Acts.9.8" n="8" />And Saul arose from the earth, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one; but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
<verse eID="Acts.9.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.9" osisID="Acts.9.9" n="9" />And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.9.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.10" osisID="Acts.9.10" n="10" />Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision: Ananias. He answered: Behold me, Lord.
<verse eID="Acts.9.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.11" osisID="Acts.9.11" n="11" />And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the street that is called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus: for behold, he is praying;
<verse eID="Acts.9.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.12" osisID="Acts.9.12" n="12" />and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in and laying his hand on him, that he may receive his sight.
<verse eID="Acts.9.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.13" osisID="Acts.9.13" n="13" />But Ananias answered: Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints in Jerusalem;
<verse eID="Acts.9.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.14" osisID="Acts.9.14" n="14" />and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name.
<verse eID="Acts.9.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.15" osisID="Acts.9.15" n="15" />But the Lord said to him: Go; for he is a vessel chosen by me to bear my name before nations and kings, and the sons of Israel.
<verse eID="Acts.9.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.16" osisID="Acts.9.16" n="16" />For I will show him what great things he must suffer for my name.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.9.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.17" osisID="Acts.9.17" n="17" />And Ananias went, and entered the house, and laying his hands on him, said: Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Acts.9.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.18" osisID="Acts.9.18" n="18" />And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he instantly received his sight; and he arose, and was immersed.
<verse eID="Acts.9.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.19" osisID="Acts.9.19" n="19" />And, having taken food, he was strengthened.
</p>
<p>
And he was with the disciples in Damascus for some days;
<verse eID="Acts.9.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.20" osisID="Acts.9.20" n="20" />and immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Sou of God.
<verse eID="Acts.9.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.21" osisID="Acts.9.21" n="21" />And all that heard him were astonished, and said: Is not this he who destroyed in Jerusalem those that call on this name, and who has come hither for this purpose, that he might carry them bound to the chief priests?
<verse eID="Acts.9.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.22" osisID="Acts.9.22" n="22" />But Saul increased the more in strength, and confuted the Jews that dwelt in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.9.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.23" osisID="Acts.9.23" n="23" />And, after many days had passed, the Jews determined to kill him.
<verse eID="Acts.9.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.24" osisID="Acts.9.24" n="24" />And their plot was made known to Saul; and they watched the gates day and night, that they might kill him.
<verse eID="Acts.9.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.25" osisID="Acts.9.25" n="25" />But the disciples took him by night, and let him down through the vail in a basket,
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.9.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.26" osisID="Acts.9.26" n="26" />And having come to Jerusalem, he attempted to associate with the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.
<verse eID="Acts.9.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.27" osisID="Acts.9.27" n="27" />But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and told them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had boldly preached in Damascus in the name of Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.9.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.28" osisID="Acts.9.28" n="28" />And he was with them in Jerusalem, coming in and going out; and, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus,
<verse eID="Acts.9.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.29" osisID="Acts.9.29" n="29" />he conversed and reasoned with the Hellenists; but they undertook to kill him.
<verse eID="Acts.9.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.30" osisID="Acts.9.30" n="30" />And when the brethren learned this, they brought him down to Cæsarea, and sent him out to Tarsus.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.9.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.31" osisID="Acts.9.31" n="31" />Then the churches throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.9.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.32" osisID="Acts.9.32" n="32" />And it came to pass that Peter, passing through all the places, came down also to the saints that dwelt in Lydda.
<verse eID="Acts.9.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.33" osisID="Acts.9.33" n="33" />And he found there a certain man named Æneas, who was a paralytic, and had kept his bed for eight years.
<verse eID="Acts.9.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.34" osisID="Acts.9.34" n="34" />And Peter said to him: Æneas, Jesus the Christ restores you to health; arise, and spread your bed for yourself. And he immediately arose;
<verse eID="Acts.9.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.35" osisID="Acts.9.35" n="35" />and all that dwelt in Lydda and Saron saw him; and they turned to the Lord.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.9.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.36" osisID="Acts.9.36" n="36" />Now there was in Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which name, when translated, is Dorcas. She was full of good works and deeds of charity which she did.
<verse eID="Acts.9.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.37" osisID="Acts.9.37" n="37" />And it came to pass, in those days, that she was taken sick, and died. And when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.
<verse eID="Acts.9.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.38" osisID="Acts.9.38" n="38" />And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, requesting him to make no delay in coming to them.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.9.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.39" osisID="Acts.9.39" n="39" />Then Peter arose, and went with them; and when he had come, they brought him into the upper room; and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.
<verse eID="Acts.9.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.40" osisID="Acts.9.40" n="40" />But Peter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said: Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
<verse eID="Acts.9.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.41" osisID="Acts.9.41" n="41" />And he gave her his hand, and raised her up. And when he had called in the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.
<verse eID="Acts.9.41" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.42" osisID="Acts.9.42" n="42" />And it was known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.
<verse eID="Acts.9.42" />
<verse sID="Acts.9.43" osisID="Acts.9.43" n="43" />And it came to pass, that he remained many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.
<verse eID="Acts.9.43" />

<p>
<chapter sID="Acts.10" osisID="Acts.10" n="10" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.1" osisID="Acts.10.1" n="1" />Now there was a certain man in Cæsarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,
<verse eID="Acts.10.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.2" osisID="Acts.10.2" n="2" />a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who did many acts of charity to the people, and prayed to God always.
<verse eID="Acts.10.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.3" osisID="Acts.10.3" n="3" />He distinctly saw, in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.10.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.4" osisID="Acts.10.4" n="4" />And having looked steadily on him, he was afraid, and said: What is it, Lord? He said to him: Your prayers and your charitable deeds have come up for a memorial before God.
<verse eID="Acts.10.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.5" osisID="Acts.10.5" n="5" />And now send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter;
<verse eID="Acts.10.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.6" osisID="Acts.10.6" n="6" />he lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea.
<verse eID="Acts.10.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.7" osisID="Acts.10.7" n="7" />When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier, one of those who waited on him,
<verse eID="Acts.10.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.8" osisID="Acts.10.8" n="8" />and having made known all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.10.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.9" osisID="Acts.10.9" n="9" />And on the morrow, as they were going on their journey, and were drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.
<verse eID="Acts.10.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.10" osisID="Acts.10.10" n="10" />And he became very hungry, and desired to eat; but while they were making ready, he fell into a trance;
<verse eID="Acts.10.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.11" osisID="Acts.10.11" n="11" />and he saw heaven opened, and some vessel, like a great sheet, descending, bound by the four corners, and let down to the earth.
<verse eID="Acts.10.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.12" osisID="Acts.10.12" n="12" />In this were all kinds of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the air.
<verse eID="Acts.10.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.13" osisID="Acts.10.13" n="13" />And there came a voice to him: Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
<verse eID="Acts.10.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.14" osisID="Acts.10.14" n="14" />But Peter said: By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing common or unclean.
<verse eID="Acts.10.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.15" osisID="Acts.10.15" n="15" />And the voice came to him again a second time: What God has cleansed, you must not call common.
<verse eID="Acts.10.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.16" osisID="Acts.10.16" n="16" />This was done the third time; and the vessel was taken up again into heaven.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.10.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.17" osisID="Acts.10.17" n="17" />Now, while Peter was perplexed within himself about the meaning of the vision which he had seen, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius, having made inquiry for the house of Simon, stood before the gate.
<verse eID="Acts.10.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.18" osisID="Acts.10.18" n="18" />And they called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodged there.
<verse eID="Acts.10.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.19" osisID="Acts.10.19" n="19" />While Peter was thinking of the vision, the Spirit said to him: Behold, three men ask for you:
<verse eID="Acts.10.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.20" osisID="Acts.10.20" n="20" />arise then, and go down, and go with them without hesitation, for I have sent them.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.10.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.21" osisID="Acts.10.21" n="21" />And Peter came down to the men, and said: Behold, I am he whom you seek; what is the cause of your coming?
<verse eID="Acts.10.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.22" osisID="Acts.10.22" n="22" />They replied: Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God, and of good report among the whole nation of the Jews, was instructed by a holy angel to call you to his house, and to hear words from you.
<verse eID="Acts.10.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.23" osisID="Acts.10.23" n="23" />Then he called them in, and lodged them.
</p>
<p>
On the morrow he arose, and went with them; and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
<verse eID="Acts.10.23" />

<verse sID="Acts.10.26" osisID="Acts.10.26" n="26" />But Peter raised him up, saying: Stand up; I also am a man.
<verse eID="Acts.10.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.27" osisID="Acts.10.27" n="27" />And; conversing with him, he went in, and found many that had come together.

<verse sID="Acts.10.28" osisID="Acts.10.28" n="28" />And he said to them: You know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with one of another nation, or to go into his house. But God has showed me that I must not call any man common or unclean.
<verse eID="Acts.10.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.29" osisID="Acts.10.29" n="29" />For this reason, when I was sent for, I came without making objection. I ask, therefore, for what purpose have you sent for me?

<verse sID="Acts.10.30" osisID="Acts.10.30" n="30" />And Cornelius replied: Four days ago, I was fasting till this hour; and, at the ninth hour, I was praying in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,

<verse sID="Acts.10.31" osisID="Acts.10.31" n="31" />and said: Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your deeds of charity are remembered before God.
<verse eID="Acts.10.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.32" osisID="Acts.10.32" n="32" />Send, therefore, to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea; who, when he comes, will speak to you.
<verse eID="Acts.10.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.33" osisID="Acts.10.33" n="33" />Therefore, I immediately sent to you; and you have done well in coming. Now, therefore, we are all here present before God, to hear all things that are given in charge to you by God.

<verse sID="Acts.10.34" osisID="Acts.10.34" n="34" />And Peter opened his mouth, and said: In truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;
<verse eID="Acts.10.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.35" osisID="Acts.10.35" n="35" />but, in every nation, he that fears him and works righteousness is accepted by him.

<verse eID="Acts.10.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.38" osisID="Acts.10.38" n="38" />how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit, and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.
<verse eID="Acts.10.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.39" osisID="Acts.10.39" n="39" />And we are witnesses of all that he did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew by hanging him on a tree.

<verse sID="Acts.10.45" osisID="Acts.10.45" n="45" />And the believers that were of the circumcision, as many as had come with Peter, were astonished, because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit:
<verse eID="Acts.10.45" />
<verse sID="Acts.10.46" osisID="Acts.10.46" n="46" />for they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then Peter answered:

<verse sID="Acts.10.47" osisID="Acts.10.47" n="47" />Can any one forbid the water, that these should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?

<verse eID="Acts.11.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.2" osisID="Acts.11.2" n="2" />And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,

<verse sID="Acts.11.5" osisID="Acts.11.5" n="5" />I was in the city of Joppa, praying; and, while in a trance, I saw a vision, some vessel like a great sheet, descending, let down from heaven by the four corners; and it came even to me.

<verse sID="Acts.11.6" osisID="Acts.11.6" n="6" />When I had looked attentively into it, I observed and saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the air.
<verse eID="Acts.11.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.7" osisID="Acts.11.7" n="7" />And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
<verse eID="Acts.11.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.8" osisID="Acts.11.8" n="8" />But I said, By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.
<verse eID="Acts.11.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.9" osisID="Acts.11.9" n="9" />But the voice answered me a second time from heaven, What God has cleansed, you must not call common.
<verse eID="Acts.11.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.10" osisID="Acts.11.10" n="10" />This was done the third time, and all was drawn up again into heaven.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.11.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.11.11" osisID="Acts.11.11" n="11" />And behold, three men who had been sent to me from Cæsarea, immediately came to the house where I was.

<verse eID="Acts.12.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.11" osisID="Acts.12.11" n="11" />And when Peter came to himself, he said: Now I know, in truth, that the Lord has sent his angel, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod, and from all that was expected by the Jewish people.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.12.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.12.12" osisID="Acts.12.12" n="12" />And being aware of his condition, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, who is surnamed Mark, where many had met together, and were praying.

<verse sID="Acts.13.23" osisID="Acts.13.23" n="23" />From the posterity of this man, God, according to his promise, raised up for Israel a Savior, Jesus;

<verse eID="Acts.13.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.34" osisID="Acts.13.34" n="34" />But that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus: I will give you the sure mercies of David.
<verse eID="Acts.13.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.35" osisID="Acts.13.35" n="35" />For which reason he says also in another Psalm: Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.

<verse sID="Acts.13.46" osisID="Acts.13.46" n="46" />But Paul and Barnabas, speaking boldly, said: It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first: but since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo! we turn to tho Gentiles.
<verse eID="Acts.13.46" />
<verse sID="Acts.13.47" osisID="Acts.13.47" n="47" />For thus has the Lord given us commandment: I have placed thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be for salvation to the most distant part of the earth.

<verse sID="Acts.14.11" osisID="Acts.14.11" n="11" />When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, and said, in the Lycaonian language: The Gods have come down to us in the likeness of men.

<verse sID="Acts.14.14" osisID="Acts.14.14" n="14" />But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the multitude, crying out,

<verse eID="Acts.15.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.2" osisID="Acts.15.2" n="2" />Therefore, after Paul and Barnabas had no little dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others from among them, should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.

<verse sID="Acts.15.8" osisID="Acts.15.8" n="8" />And God, who knows the heart, became a witness for them, by giving them the Holy Spirit, as he gave it also to us;

<verse sID="Acts.15.10" osisID="Acts.15.10" n="10" />Now, therefore, why do you put God to the proof, by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers, nor we ourselves, were able to bear?

<verse eID="Acts.15.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.14" osisID="Acts.15.14" n="14" />Simeon has declared how God, at the first, did visit the Gentiles, in order to take out from among them a people for his name.
<verse eID="Acts.15.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.15" osisID="Acts.15.15" n="15" />And with this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
<verse eID="Acts.15.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.16" osisID="Acts.15.16" n="16" />After this I will return, and build again the tabernacle of David which has fallen down; and I will build again its ruins, and I will set it up;
<verse eID="Acts.15.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.17" osisID="Acts.15.17" n="17" />that the rest of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name has been called, says the Lord, who does all these things.

<verse eID="Acts.15.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.19" osisID="Acts.15.19" n="19" />For these reasons, my judgment is, that we give no trouble to those who, from among the Gentiles, have turned to God;
<verse eID="Acts.15.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.20" osisID="Acts.15.20" n="20" />but that we write to them to abstain from pollutions of idols, and from lewdness, and from what is strangled, and from blood.

<verse sID="Acts.15.24" osisID="Acts.15.24" n="24" />Inasmuch as we have heard that certain persons went out from us and troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, That you must be circumcised, and keep the law, to whom we gave no commandment,
<verse eID="Acts.15.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.25" osisID="Acts.15.25" n="25" />it has seemed good to us, having come together with one mind, to send chosen men to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
<verse eID="Acts.15.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.26" osisID="Acts.15.26" n="26" />men who have endangered their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.15.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.27" osisID="Acts.15.27" n="27" />We have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, who will tell you the same things in word.
<verse eID="Acts.15.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.28" osisID="Acts.15.28" n="28" />For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
<verse eID="Acts.15.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.29" osisID="Acts.15.29" n="29" />That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from lewdness; from which if you keep yourselves carefully, you will do well. Farewell.

<verse eID="Acts.15.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.30" osisID="Acts.15.30" n="30" />So when these men were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and having assembled the multitude, they delivered this letter.
<verse eID="Acts.15.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.31" osisID="Acts.15.31" n="31" />When they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation which it gave.
<verse eID="Acts.15.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.15.32" osisID="Acts.15.32" n="32" />And Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and strengthened them.

<verse sID="Acts.15.38" osisID="Acts.15.38" n="38" />But Paul did not think it proper to take with them him who had departed from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work.

<verse eID="Acts.16.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.3" osisID="Acts.16.3" n="3" />This man Paul wished to go with him: and he took him and circumcised him, on account of the Jews that were in those places: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
<verse eID="Acts.16.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.4" osisID="Acts.16.4" n="4" />And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees that had been resolved on by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, that they might keep them.
<verse eID="Acts.16.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.5" osisID="Acts.16.5" n="5" />Therefore, the churches were established in the faith, and they increased in number daily.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.16.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.6" osisID="Acts.16.6" n="6" />When they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,
<verse eID="Acts.16.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.7" osisID="Acts.16.7" n="7" />and had come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit did not permit them.
<verse eID="Acts.16.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.8" osisID="Acts.16.8" n="8" />But having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
<verse eID="Acts.16.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.9" osisID="Acts.16.9" n="9" />And, during the night, a vision appeared to Paul. A certain man of Macedonia stood and besought him, saying: Come over to Macedonia and help us.
<verse eID="Acts.16.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.10" osisID="Acts.16.10" n="10" />After he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavored to go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.16.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.11" osisID="Acts.16.11" n="11" />Therefore, setting sail from Troas, we came by a straight course to Samothracia, and, on the following day, to Neapolis,
<verse eID="Acts.16.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.12" osisID="Acts.16.12" n="12" />and thence to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony. We remained in that city some days:
<verse eID="Acts.16.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.13" osisID="Acts.16.13" n="13" />and on the sabbath-day we went out of the city to the side of a river, where, as usual, was the house of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
<verse eID="Acts.16.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.14" osisID="Acts.16.14" n="14" />And a certain woman, named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, heard; whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things that were spoken by Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.16.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.15" osisID="Acts.16.15" n="15" />And when she and her household had been immersed, she besought us, saying: If you judge me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and make it your home. And she con strained us.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.16.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.16" osisID="Acts.16.16" n="16" />And it came to pass, that as we were going to the house of prayer, there met us a certain maid-servant that had a spirit of Python, who brought much gain to her masters, by giving responses.
<verse eID="Acts.16.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.17" osisID="Acts.16.17" n="17" />She followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying: These men are the servants of the most High God, who show us the way of salvation.
<verse eID="Acts.16.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.18" osisID="Acts.16.18" n="18" />And this she continued to do for many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit: I command you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.16.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.19" osisID="Acts.16.19" n="19" />And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the market to the rulers.
<verse eID="Acts.16.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.20" osisID="Acts.16.20" n="20" />And having brought them to the magistrates, they said: These men, who are Jews, do greatly trouble our city;
<verse eID="Acts.16.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.21" osisID="Acts.16.21" n="21" />and they teach customs which it is not lawful for us, who are Romans, to receive or to observe.
<verse eID="Acts.16.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.22" osisID="Acts.16.22" n="22" />And the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates stripped off their clothes, and gave command to beat them with rods.
<verse eID="Acts.16.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.23" osisID="Acts.16.23" n="23" />And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, and charged the jailer to keep them securely.
<verse eID="Acts.16.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.24" osisID="Acts.16.24" n="24" />And having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.16.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.25" osisID="Acts.16.25" n="25" />And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sung a hymn to God; and the prisoners were listening to them.
<verse eID="Acts.16.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.26" osisID="Acts.16.26" n="26" />And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bonds were loosed.
<verse eID="Acts.16.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.27" osisID="Acts.16.27" n="27" />And the jailer, being aroused from sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword, and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.
<verse eID="Acts.16.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.28" osisID="Acts.16.28" n="28" />But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying: Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.16.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.29" osisID="Acts.16.29" n="29" />Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and trembling, he fell down before Paul and Silas;
<verse eID="Acts.16.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.30" osisID="Acts.16.30" n="30" />and, having brought them out, he said: Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
<verse eID="Acts.16.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.31" osisID="Acts.16.31" n="31" />They replied: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and your house shall be saved.
<verse eID="Acts.16.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.32" osisID="Acts.16.32" n="32" />And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all that were in his house.
<verse eID="Acts.16.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.33" osisID="Acts.16.33" n="33" />And he took them at that hour of the night, and washed the blood from their stripes; and he was immersed, himself and all his, immediately.
<verse eID="Acts.16.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.34" osisID="Acts.16.34" n="34" />And he brought them into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God, with all his house.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.16.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.35" osisID="Acts.16.35" n="35" />But when it was day, the magistrates sent the lictors, saying: Release those men.
<verse eID="Acts.16.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.36" osisID="Acts.16.36" n="36" />And the jailer told these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent to release you. Now, therefore, come out, and go in peace.
<verse eID="Acts.16.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.37" osisID="Acts.16.37" n="37" />But Paul said to them: Having publicly scourged us uncondemned, us who are Romans, they threw us into prison: and do they now put us out secretly? No, verily: but let them come and lead us out.
<verse eID="Acts.16.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.38" osisID="Acts.16.38" n="38" />And the lictors told these words to the magistrates: and they were alarmed when they heard that they were Romans;
<verse eID="Acts.16.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.39" osisID="Acts.16.39" n="39" />and they came, and entreated them, and led them out, and requested them to depart from the city.
<verse eID="Acts.16.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.16.40" osisID="Acts.16.40" n="40" />And having come out of the prison, they went into the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.

<verse sID="Acts.17.1" osisID="Acts.17.1" n="1" />And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
<verse eID="Acts.17.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.2" osisID="Acts.17.2" n="2" />And Paul, according to his custom, went in to them, and, for three sabbath-days, he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
<verse eID="Acts.17.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.3" osisID="Acts.17.3" n="3" />explaining and affirming that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead; and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.17.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.4" osisID="Acts.17.4" n="4" />And some of them believed, and associated themselves with Paul and Silas; of the devout Greeks, a great multitude, and of the chief women, not a few.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.17.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.5" osisID="Acts.17.5" n="5" />But the unbelieving Jews, taking with them some evil men, who were loungers about the markets, and collecting a mob, set the city in an uproar; and having assaulted the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.
<verse eID="Acts.17.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.6" osisID="Acts.17.6" n="6" />But not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying out: These men, who have thrown the world into confusion, have come hither also;
<verse eID="Acts.17.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.7" osisID="Acts.17.7" n="7" />whom Jason has received into his house: and they all act in opposition to the decrees of Cæsar, saying, That there is another king, Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.17.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.8" osisID="Acts.17.8" n="8" />And the multitude, and the rulers of the city, were troubled when they heard these things.
<verse eID="Acts.17.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.9" osisID="Acts.17.9" n="9" />And they took security of Jason, and of the others, and let them go.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.17.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.10" osisID="Acts.17.10" n="10" />And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea; and when they had come, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
<verse eID="Acts.17.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.11" osisID="Acts.17.11" n="11" />These were of a better disposition than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.
<verse eID="Acts.17.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.12" osisID="Acts.17.12" n="12" />Therefore, many of them believed; both of influential women, who were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
<verse eID="Acts.17.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.13" osisID="Acts.17.13" n="13" />But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul in Berea also, they came thither, and excited the multitude.
<verse eID="Acts.17.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.14" osisID="Acts.17.14" n="14" />Then the brethren immediately sent Paul away, to go as if to the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.
<verse eID="Acts.17.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.15" osisID="Acts.17.15" n="15" />And those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and having received a commandment for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.17.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.16" osisID="Acts.17.16" n="16" />Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he saw the city full of idols.
<verse eID="Acts.17.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.17" osisID="Acts.17.17" n="17" />Accordingly, he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and devout persons, and in the market daily, with those who chanced to meet him.
<verse eID="Acts.17.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.18" osisID="Acts.17.18" n="18" />And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers disputed with him; and some said: What can this babbler possibly wish to say? Others said: He seems to be a proclaimer of strange demons: for he preached to them Jesus and the Resurrection.
<verse eID="Acts.17.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.19" osisID="Acts.17.19" n="19" />And they took him, and brought him to Mars hill, saying: Are we able to understand what this new teaching is, which is announced by you?
<verse eID="Acts.17.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.20" osisID="Acts.17.20" n="20" />For you bring some strange things to our ears: we wish to understand then what these things mean.
<verse eID="Acts.17.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.21" osisID="Acts.17.21" n="21" />For all the Athenians and resident strangers have leisure for nothing else than to tell or to hear some new thing.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.17.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.22" osisID="Acts.17.22" n="22" />Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars hill, and said: Men of Athens, I perceive that in all respects your reverence for demons excels that of other men.
<verse eID="Acts.17.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.23" osisID="Acts.17.23" n="23" />For as I was passing through, and looking attentively at the objects of your worship, I dis covered also an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him I make known to you.
<verse eID="Acts.17.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.24" osisID="Acts.17.24" n="24" />God, who made the world, and all things that are in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;
<verse eID="Acts.17.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.25" osisID="Acts.17.25" n="25" />nor is he ministered to by the hands of men, as if he needed any thing: for he himself gives to all life, and breath, and all things:
<verse eID="Acts.17.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.26" osisID="Acts.17.26" n="26" />and he has made from one blood every nation of men, that they might dwell on all the face of the earth, having marked out their appointed times, and the bounds of their dwelling:
<verse eID="Acts.17.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.27" osisID="Acts.17.27" n="27" />that they might seek for God, if perhaps they would feel after him, and find him, although, indeed, he is not far from every one of us.
<verse eID="Acts.17.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.28" osisID="Acts.17.28" n="28" />For in him we live, and move, and have our being: as also some of your own poets have said: For we his offspring are.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.17.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.29" osisID="Acts.17.29" n="29" />Therefore, being the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhood is like gold, or silver, or stone, sculptured by art and the device of man.
<verse eID="Acts.17.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.30" osisID="Acts.17.30" n="30" />Yet the times of this ignorance God overlooked; but now, he commands all men everywhere to repent:
<verse eID="Acts.17.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.31" osisID="Acts.17.31" n="31" />because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world, in righteousness, by the man whom he has chosen, giving to all assurance of this, by having raised him from the dead.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.17.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.32" osisID="Acts.17.32" n="32" />And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; others said: We will hear you again concerning this matter.
<verse eID="Acts.17.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.33" osisID="Acts.17.33" n="33" />And so Paul departed from among them.
<verse eID="Acts.17.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.17.34" osisID="Acts.17.34" n="34" />But certain men associated with him, and believed; among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

<verse eID="Acts.18.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.2" osisID="Acts.18.2" n="2" />and finding a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had lately come from Italy, with Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome, he went to them;
<verse eID="Acts.18.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.3" osisID="Acts.18.3" n="3" />and because he was of the same trade, he made his home with them, and worked: for by trade they were tent-makers.
<verse eID="Acts.18.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.4" osisID="Acts.18.4" n="4" />But on every sabbath, he reasoned in the synagogue, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
<verse eID="Acts.18.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.5" osisID="Acts.18.5" n="5" />And when Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul was roused in spirit, and earnestly testified to the Jews, that-the Christ was Jesus.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.18.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.6" osisID="Acts.18.6" n="6" />But when they set themselves in opposition, and reviled, he shook his clothing, and said to them: Your blood be upon your own head; I am clean. Henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.
<verse eID="Acts.18.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.7" osisID="Acts.18.7" n="7" />And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, who worshiped God, and whose house joined the synagogue.
<verse eID="Acts.18.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.8" osisID="Acts.18.8" n="8" />But Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were immersed.
<verse eID="Acts.18.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.9" osisID="Acts.18.9" n="9" />And the Lord spoke to Paul by a vision in the night: Fear not; but speak, and be not silent;
<verse eID="Acts.18.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.10" osisID="Acts.18.10" n="10" />for I am with you, and no one shall make an assault upon you, to injure you; for I have many people in this city.
<verse eID="Acts.18.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.11" osisID="Acts.18.11" n="11" />And he remained there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.18.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.12" osisID="Acts.18.12" n="12" />But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews, with one mind, suddenly came upon Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat,
<verse eID="Acts.18.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.13" osisID="Acts.18.13" n="13" />saying: This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.
<verse eID="Acts.18.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.14" osisID="Acts.18.14" n="14" />But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: If it were a matter of injustice, or of wicked mischief, O Jews, I would, with reason, bear with you:
<verse eID="Acts.18.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.15" osisID="Acts.18.15" n="15" />but if it is a question about a word, and names, and your law, see to it yourselves: for I will not be a judge of these tilings.
<verse eID="Acts.18.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.16" osisID="Acts.18.16" n="16" />And he drove them from the judgment-seat.

<verse sID="Acts.18.17" osisID="Acts.18.17" n="17" />And all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.

<verse eID="Acts.18.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.22" osisID="Acts.18.22" n="22" />and having landed at Cæsarea, and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.

<verse eID="Acts.18.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.18.27" osisID="Acts.18.27" n="27" />And when he wished to pass into Achaia, the brethren, exhorting him, wrote to the disciples to receive him. And when he had come, he gave much help to the believers, through the grace conferred on him.
<verse eID="Acts.18.27" />

<chapter sID="Acts.19" osisID="Acts.19" n="19" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.1" osisID="Acts.19.1" n="1" />And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, after passing through the upper districts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples,
<verse eID="Acts.19.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.2" osisID="Acts.19.2" n="2" />said to them: Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed? They said to him: <transChange type="added">We have not only not received it,</transChange> but we have not even heard whether the Holy Spirit is given.
<verse eID="Acts.19.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.3" osisID="Acts.19.3" n="3" />And he said to them: Into what, then, were you immersed? They replied: Into John’s immersion.
<verse eID="Acts.19.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.4" osisID="Acts.19.4" n="4" />And Paul said: John immersed with the immersion of repentance, saying to the people, that they must believe on him who should come after him, that is, on the Christ, Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.19.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.5" osisID="Acts.19.5" n="5" />And when they heard this, they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.19.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.6" osisID="Acts.19.6" n="6" />And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.
<verse eID="Acts.19.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.7" osisID="Acts.19.7" n="7" />And all the men were about twelve.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.19.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.8" osisID="Acts.19.8" n="8" />And he entered the synagogue, and spoke boldly, reasoning, and persuading them for three months, with respect to the things of the kingdom of God.
<verse eID="Acts.19.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.9" osisID="Acts.19.9" n="9" />But as some were hardened, and did not believe, and spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he withdrew from them, and separated the disciples, and discoursed daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
<verse eID="Acts.19.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.10" osisID="Acts.19.10" n="10" />This continued for two years; so that all that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
<verse eID="Acts.19.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.11" osisID="Acts.19.11" n="11" />Mighty deeds, also, that were unusual, did God perform by the hands of Paul;
<verse eID="Acts.19.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.12" osisID="Acts.19.12" n="12" />so that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the sick, and diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits came out of them.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.19.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.13" osisID="Acts.19.13" n="13" />And some of the roving Jews, who were exorcists, undertook to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying: I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.
<verse eID="Acts.19.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.14" osisID="Acts.19.14" n="14" />And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.
<verse eID="Acts.19.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.15" osisID="Acts.19.15" n="15" />But the evil spirit answered and said: Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know; but who are you?
<verse eID="Acts.19.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.16" osisID="Acts.19.16" n="16" />And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled from that house, naked and wounded.
<verse eID="Acts.19.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.17" osisID="Acts.19.17" n="17" />And this became known to all the Greeks and Jews that dwelt in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
<verse eID="Acts.19.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.18" osisID="Acts.19.18" n="18" />And many of those who believed came and confessed, and made known their practices.
<verse eID="Acts.19.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.19" osisID="Acts.19.19" n="19" />And many of those who practiced magic, brought together their books, and burned them, in the presence of all. And they computed their value, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
<verse eID="Acts.19.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.20" osisID="Acts.19.20" n="20" />So mightily did the word of the Lord grow and prevail.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.19.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.21" osisID="Acts.19.21" n="21" />When these things had been accomplished, Paul purposed in spirit to go to Jerusalem, after he should pass through Macedonia and Achaia, saying: After I have been there, I must see Rome also.
<verse eID="Acts.19.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.22" osisID="Acts.19.22" n="22" />So, having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he remained for a time in Asia.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.19.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.23" osisID="Acts.19.23" n="23" />And at that time there was no little excitement about that way.
<verse eID="Acts.19.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.24" osisID="Acts.19.24" n="24" />For a certain man, named Demetrius, a silversmith, by making silver shrines for Diana, furnished no little trade to the artists.
<verse eID="Acts.19.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.25" osisID="Acts.19.25" n="25" />These he called together, with the workmen employed about such things, and said: Men, you know that our wealth arises from this trade:
<verse eID="Acts.19.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.26" osisID="Acts.19.26" n="26" />and you see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost the whole of Asia, this Paul, by his persuasions, has drawn away a great multitude, saying, that they which are made with hands are not gods.
<verse eID="Acts.19.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.27" osisID="Acts.19.27" n="27" />Now there is danger, not only that this our calling will come into disgrace, but that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be despised, and that the majesty of her whom all Asia and the world worships, will be destroyed.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.19.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.28" osisID="Acts.19.28" n="28" />When they heard this, they were full of anger, and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!
<verse eID="Acts.19.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.29" osisID="Acts.19.29" n="29" />And the whole city was filled with confusion. And they seized Gains and Aristarchus, who were Macedonians, Paul’s fellow-travelers, and, with one consent, rushed into the theater.
<verse eID="Acts.19.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.30" osisID="Acts.19.30" n="30" />And when Paul wished to go in among the people, the disciples did not permit him.
<verse eID="Acts.19.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.31" osisID="Acts.19.31" n="31" />Some of the Asiarchs also, who were friendly to him, sent to him, and besought him not to trust himself into the theater.
<verse eID="Acts.19.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.32" osisID="Acts.19.32" n="32" />Some, therefore, were crying one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not for what they had come together.
<verse eID="Acts.19.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.33" osisID="Acts.19.33" n="33" />And some of the multitude put Alexander forward, the Jews urging him on. And Alexander waved his hand, and wished to make a defense to the people.
<verse eID="Acts.19.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.34" osisID="Acts.19.34" n="34" />But perceiving that he was a Jew, they all cried out, with one voice, for about two hours: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.19.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.35" osisID="Acts.19.35" n="35" />But the town-clerk quieted the multitude, and said: Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great Diana, and of the image that fell down from Jupiter?
<verse eID="Acts.19.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.36" osisID="Acts.19.36" n="36" />As these things, then, can not be contradicted, you ought to be quiet, and do nothing rashly.
<verse eID="Acts.19.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.37" osisID="Acts.19.37" n="37" />For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples, nor revilers of your goddess.
<verse eID="Acts.19.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.38" osisID="Acts.19.38" n="38" />Therefore, if Demetrius, and the artists who are with him, have a charge against any one, the courts are in session, and the proconsuls are there; let them accuse each other.
<verse eID="Acts.19.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.39" osisID="Acts.19.39" n="39" />But if you have any inquiries to make about other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
<verse eID="Acts.19.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.40" osisID="Acts.19.40" n="40" />For we are in danger of being called to answer for this day’s tumult, since there is no cause by which we shall be able to account for this concourse.
<verse eID="Acts.19.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.19.41" osisID="Acts.19.41" n="41" />And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
<verse eID="Acts.19.41" />

<chapter sID="Acts.20" osisID="Acts.20" n="20" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.1" osisID="Acts.20.1" n="1" />After the tumult had ceased, Paul called the disciples to him, and bade them farewell, and departed, in order to go into Macedonia.
<verse eID="Acts.20.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.2" osisID="Acts.20.2" n="2" />And when he had gone through those regions, and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece.
<verse eID="Acts.20.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.3" osisID="Acts.20.3" n="3" />And having remained there three months, he determined to return through Macedonia, because a plot had been laid for him by the Jews, as he was about to sail to Syria.
<verse eID="Acts.20.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.4" osisID="Acts.20.4" n="4" />And Sopater of Berea, and Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy and Tychicus and Trophimus, who were Asiatics, accompanied him to Asia.
<verse eID="Acts.20.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.5" osisID="Acts.20.5" n="5" />These went before, and waited for us at Troas.
<verse eID="Acts.20.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.6" osisID="Acts.20.6" n="6" />But we sailed from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we remained seven days.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.20.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.7" osisID="Acts.20.7" n="7" />And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, intending to depart on the morrow; and he continued his speech till midnight.
<verse eID="Acts.20.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.8" osisID="Acts.20.8" n="8" />And there were many lamps in the upper room, in which they had met together.
<verse eID="Acts.20.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.9" osisID="Acts.20.9" n="9" />And a certain young man, named Eutychus, was sitting in the window, overpowered with deep sleep: and, as Paul was discoursing a long time, being oppressed with sleep, he fell from the third story, and was taken up dead.
<verse eID="Acts.20.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.10" osisID="Acts.20.10" n="10" />But Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him, said: Be not troubled, for his life is in him.
<verse eID="Acts.20.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.11" osisID="Acts.20.11" n="11" />And he went up again, and broke bread, and ate; and having conversed a long time, till daylight, he thus departed.
<verse eID="Acts.20.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.12" osisID="Acts.20.12" n="12" />And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.20.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.13" osisID="Acts.20.13" n="13" />And we went on before to the ship, and put to sea for Assos, intending to take Paul on board at that place; for he had so directed, intending to go himself on foot.
<verse eID="Acts.20.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.14" osisID="Acts.20.14" n="14" />And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board, and came to Mitylene;
<verse eID="Acts.20.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.15" osisID="Acts.20.15" n="15" />and sailing from that place, we came, on the following day, opposite to Chios; and, on the next day, we arrived at Samos: and after stopping at Trogyllium, we came, on the next day, to Miletus.
<verse eID="Acts.20.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.16" osisID="Acts.20.16" n="16" />For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not spend time in Asia; for he hastened, that, if it were possible for him, he might be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.20.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.17" osisID="Acts.20.17" n="17" />From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
<verse eID="Acts.20.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.18" osisID="Acts.20.18" n="18" />And when they had come to him, he said to them: You know, from the first day on which I came into Asia, how I have been with you during the whole time,
<verse eID="Acts.20.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.19" osisID="Acts.20.19" n="19" />serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials, which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;
<verse eID="Acts.20.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.20" osisID="Acts.20.20" n="20" />and that I have kept back nothing that was profitable, but have preached to you, and taught you both publicly, and from house to house,
<verse eID="Acts.20.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.21" osisID="Acts.20.21" n="21" />bearing full testimony both to Jews and to Greeks, of the repentance that leads to God, and of the faith that leads to our Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.20.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.22" osisID="Acts.20.22" n="22" />And now, behold, I am going, bound in spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing what shall befall me there,
<verse eID="Acts.20.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.23" osisID="Acts.20.23" n="23" />except that in every city the Holy Spirit testifies to me, saying, That bonds and afflictions await me.
<verse eID="Acts.20.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.24" osisID="Acts.20.24" n="24" />But I esteem this a matter of no importance, nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry that I have received from the Lord Jesus, to bear full testimony to the gospel of the grace of God.
<verse eID="Acts.20.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.25" osisID="Acts.20.25" n="25" />And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.
<verse eID="Acts.20.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.26" osisID="Acts.20.26" n="26" />For this reason I solemnly affirm to you this day, that I am clean from the blood of all men.
<verse eID="Acts.20.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.27" osisID="Acts.20.27" n="27" />For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.20.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.28" osisID="Acts.20.28" n="28" />Therefore, take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, that you be shepherds to the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.
<verse eID="Acts.20.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.29" osisID="Acts.20.29" n="29" />For I know this, that, after my departure, rapacious wolves will enter in among you, who will not spare the flock;
<verse eID="Acts.20.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.30" osisID="Acts.20.30" n="30" />and men will arise from among yourselves, speaking perverse things, that they may draw off disciples after them.
<verse eID="Acts.20.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.31" osisID="Acts.20.31" n="31" />Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, by day and by night, I ceased not to warn every one of you with tears.
<verse eID="Acts.20.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.32" osisID="Acts.20.32" n="32" />And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace; to Him who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all the sanctified.
<verse eID="Acts.20.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.33" osisID="Acts.20.33" n="33" />I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
<verse eID="Acts.20.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.34" osisID="Acts.20.34" n="34" />You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me.
<verse eID="Acts.20.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.35" osisID="Acts.20.35" n="35" />In all things I have taught you by example, that by thus laboring, you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus; for he himself said, It is more blessed to give, than to receive.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.20.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.36" osisID="Acts.20.36" n="36" />And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.
<verse eID="Acts.20.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.37" osisID="Acts.20.37" n="37" />And they all wept much, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
<verse eID="Acts.20.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.20.38" osisID="Acts.20.38" n="38" />grieving most of all for the word he had spoken, that they would see his face no more. And they conducted him to the ship.

<chapter sID="Acts.21" osisID="Acts.21" n="21" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.1" osisID="Acts.21.1" n="1" />And it came to pass that, after we had separated from them, we put to sea, and came by a straight course to Cos, and on the following day, to Rhodes, and thence to Patara.
<verse eID="Acts.21.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.2" osisID="Acts.21.2" n="2" />And finding a ship that was going to Phenicia, we embarked, and put to sea.
<verse eID="Acts.21.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.3" osisID="Acts.21.3" n="3" />And we came in view of Cyprus; and, leaving it to the left, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to put off her lading.
<verse eID="Acts.21.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.4" osisID="Acts.21.4" n="4" />And we remained there seven days, after finding the disciples. These urged Paul, by the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.21.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.5" osisID="Acts.21.5" n="5" />And when these days were completed, we went forth, and continued our journey, they all, with their wives and children, conducting us out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
<verse eID="Acts.21.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.6" osisID="Acts.21.6" n="6" />And when we had bid each other farewell, we embarked, and they returned home.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.21.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.7" osisID="Acts.21.7" n="7" />And completing the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais: and having saluted the brethren, we remained with them one day.
<verse eID="Acts.21.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.8" osisID="Acts.21.8" n="8" />On the following day we departed, and came to Cæsarea, and went into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven; and we remained with him.
<verse eID="Acts.21.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.9" osisID="Acts.21.9" n="9" />This man had four virgin daughters, who had the gift of prophesy.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.21.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.10" osisID="Acts.21.10" n="10" />And as we remained there many days, there came down, from Judea, a certain prophet, named Agabus;
<verse eID="Acts.21.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.11" osisID="Acts.21.11" n="11" />and he came to us, and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own hands and feet, and said: Thus says the Holy Spirit; the Jews that are in Jerusalem will so bind the man to whom this girdle belongs; and they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
<verse eID="Acts.21.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.12" osisID="Acts.21.12" n="12" />And when we heard these things, we, and those of that place also, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.21.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.13" osisID="Acts.21.13" n="13" />But Paul answered: What do you effect by weeping, and breaking my heart? For I am ready, not only to be bound, but also to suffer death in Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.
<verse eID="Acts.21.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.14" osisID="Acts.21.14" n="14" />And as he would not be persuaded, we kept silence, and said: The will of the Lord be done.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.21.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.15" osisID="Acts.21.15" n="15" />And after these days we prepared for our journey, and went up to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.21.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.16" osisID="Acts.21.16" n="16" />There went with us also some of the disciples from Cæsarea, who took with them, Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.21.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.17" osisID="Acts.21.17" n="17" />And when we came to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
<verse eID="Acts.21.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.18" osisID="Acts.21.18" n="18" />And, on the following day, Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
<verse eID="Acts.21.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.19" osisID="Acts.21.19" n="19" />And when he had saluted them, he related, in every particular, the things which. God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.21.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.20" osisID="Acts.21.20" n="20" />And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him: You see, brother, how many myriads of the Jews there are that believe, and they are all zealous for the law.
<verse eID="Acts.21.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.21" osisID="Acts.21.21" n="21" />And they have heard it reported of you, that you teach all the Jews that are among the Gentiles to apostatize from Moses; commanding them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.
<verse eID="Acts.21.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.22" osisID="Acts.21.22" n="22" />What, then, is to be done? A multitude must certainly come together; for they will hear that you have come.
<verse eID="Acts.21.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.23" osisID="Acts.21.23" n="23" />Do, therefore, this which we advise you. We have four men who have a vow on them.
<verse eID="Acts.21.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.24" osisID="Acts.21.24" n="24" />Take them, and join with them in their vow of abstinence, and pay their expenses, in order that they may shave their heads; and all will know that the things which they have heard reported of you are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.
<verse eID="Acts.21.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.25" osisID="Acts.21.25" n="25" />But with respect to the Gentiles that believe, we have written; having decided that they should observe no such thing; but that they keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from lewdness.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.21.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.26" osisID="Acts.21.26" n="26" />Then Paul took the men, and, on the following day, joining in their vow of abstinence, he entered the temple, and gave notice when the days of abstinence would be completed, at which time an offering should be made for each of them.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.21.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.27" osisID="Acts.21.27" n="27" />And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, threw all the multitude into confusion, and laid their hands on him,
<verse eID="Acts.21.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.28" osisID="Acts.21.28" n="28" />crying out: Men of Israel, help! this is the man who teaches all men every where against this people, and the law, and this place: and besides, he has even brought Greeks into the temple, and defiled this holy place.
<verse eID="Acts.21.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.29" osisID="Acts.21.29" n="29" />For, before this time, they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.
<verse eID="Acts.21.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.30" osisID="Acts.21.30" n="30" />And the whole city was moved; and the people ran together, and, seizing Paul, they dragged him out of the temple, and the gates were immediately closed.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.21.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.31" osisID="Acts.21.31" n="31" />And while they were seeking to kill him, report was brought to the officer of the band, that the whole of Jerusalem was in an uproar.
<verse eID="Acts.21.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.32" osisID="Acts.21.32" n="32" />And he immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. When they saw the officer and the soldiers, they ceased beating Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.21.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.33" osisID="Acts.21.33" n="33" />Then the officer came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
<verse eID="Acts.21.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.34" osisID="Acts.21.34" n="34" />And some in the multitude cried out one thing, and some another. But not being able to obtain any certain knowledge on account of the tumult, he commanded him to be led into the fortress.
<verse eID="Acts.21.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.35" osisID="Acts.21.35" n="35" />And when he was on the steps, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers, on account of the violence of the multitude.
<verse eID="Acts.21.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.36" osisID="Acts.21.36" n="36" />For the greater part of the people followed, crying out: Away with him!
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.21.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.37" osisID="Acts.21.37" n="37" />But as Paul was about to be led into the fortress, he said to the officer: May I speak to you? He replied: Do you understand Greek?
<verse eID="Acts.21.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.38" osisID="Acts.21.38" n="38" />Are you not that Egyptian, who, before these days, made an insurrection, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men of the Assassins?
<verse eID="Acts.21.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.39" osisID="Acts.21.39" n="39" />But Paul replied: I am a Jew of Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen of no unknown city; and I beseech you, permit me to speak to the people.
<verse eID="Acts.21.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.21.40" osisID="Acts.21.40" n="40" />And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing upon the steps, waved his hand to the people. And when there was great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:

<verse eID="Acts.22.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.2" osisID="Acts.22.2" n="2" />When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they kept the greater silence. And he said:
<verse eID="Acts.22.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.3" osisID="Acts.22.3" n="3" />I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, yet educated in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, and instructed according to the strict discipline of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as you all are this day.
<verse eID="Acts.22.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.4" osisID="Acts.22.4" n="4" />And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,
<verse eID="Acts.22.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.5" osisID="Acts.22.5" n="5" />as the chief priest and the whole body of elders will testify for me. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring those, also, who were there, bound to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.22.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.6" osisID="Acts.22.6" n="6" />But it came to pass, that, as I was on my journey, and was drawing near to Damascus, about midday, there suddenly shone from heaven a great light round about me;
<verse eID="Acts.22.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.7" osisID="Acts.22.7" n="7" />and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?
<verse eID="Acts.22.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.8" osisID="Acts.22.8" n="8" />And I answered, Who art thou Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute.
<verse eID="Acts.22.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.9" osisID="Acts.22.9" n="9" />They who were with me saw the light, and were afraid, but did not understand the voice of him who spoke to me.

<verse sID="Acts.22.10" osisID="Acts.22.10" n="10" />And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus, and there you shall be told of all things that are appointed for you to do.

<verse sID="Acts.22.11" osisID="Acts.22.11" n="11" />And as I could not see for the glory of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and went into Damascus.
<verse eID="Acts.22.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.12" osisID="Acts.22.12" n="12" />And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, who had a good report from all the Jews that dwelt there,
<verse eID="Acts.22.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.13" osisID="Acts.22.13" n="13" />came to me, and standing by me, said, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And the same hour I looked upon him.
<verse eID="Acts.22.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.14" osisID="Acts.22.14" n="14" />And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice of his mouth;
<verse eID="Acts.22.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.15" osisID="Acts.22.15" n="15" />for you shall be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.

<verse eID="Acts.22.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.17" osisID="Acts.22.17" n="17" />And it came to pass, after I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance,
<verse eID="Acts.22.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.18" osisID="Acts.22.18" n="18" />and saw him saying to me, Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.

<verse sID="Acts.22.19" osisID="Acts.22.19" n="19" />And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I threw into prison, and scourged, in every synagogue, those who believed on thee;

<verse eID="Acts.22.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.21" osisID="Acts.22.21" n="21" />And he said to me, Depart, for I will send you far off to the Gentiles.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.22.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.22" osisID="Acts.22.22" n="22" />And they heard him to this word, and lifted up their voice, saying: Away with such a man from the earth! for it is not fit that he should live.
<verse eID="Acts.22.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.23" osisID="Acts.22.23" n="23" />And as they were crying out, and tossing off their clothes, and throwing dust into the air,
<verse eID="Acts.22.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.24" osisID="Acts.22.24" n="24" />the officer commanded him to be led into the fortress, and gave orders that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so cried out against him.
<verse eID="Acts.22.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.25" osisID="Acts.22.25" n="25" />But Paul said to the centurion who stood by, as he caused him to be bent forward to the straps: Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?
<verse eID="Acts.22.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.26" osisID="Acts.22.26" n="26" />And when the centurion heard that, he went out and told it to the officer, saying: What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.
<verse eID="Acts.22.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.27" osisID="Acts.22.27" n="27" />And the officer came and said to him: Tell me, are you a Roman? He answered: Yes.
<verse eID="Acts.22.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.28" osisID="Acts.22.28" n="28" />And the officer answered: With a great Bum did I purchase this citizenship. And Paul replied: But I was born a citizen.
<verse eID="Acts.22.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.22.29" osisID="Acts.22.29" n="29" />Then, those who were about to examine him, immediately departed from him. And the officer was afraid, when he learned that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.

<verse sID="Acts.22.30" osisID="Acts.22.30" n="30" />And, on the next day, wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrim to meet together. And he brought Paul down, and placed him before them.

<verse eID="Acts.23.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.2" osisID="Acts.23.2" n="2" />And the chief priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by to smite him on the mouth.
<verse eID="Acts.23.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.3" osisID="Acts.23.3" n="3" />Then Paul said to him: God will smite you, you whitened wall! for do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet violate the law by commanding me to be smitten?
<verse eID="Acts.23.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.4" osisID="Acts.23.4" n="4" />And those who stood by said: Do you revile God’s chief priest?
<verse eID="Acts.23.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.5" osisID="Acts.23.5" n="5" />And Paul replied: I did not know, brethren, that he was the chief priest: for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.23.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.6" osisID="Acts.23.6" n="6" />But when Paul perceived that one part belonged to the Sadducees, and the other to the Pharisees, he cried out, in the Sanhedrim: Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I judged.
<verse eID="Acts.23.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.7" osisID="Acts.23.7" n="7" />And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.
<verse eID="Acts.23.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.8" osisID="Acts.23.8" n="8" />For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection; neither angel nor spirit: but the Pharisees acknowledge both. And there arose a great clamor. And the scribes, on the part of the Pharisees, arose and contended, saying:
<verse eID="Acts.23.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.9" osisID="Acts.23.9" n="9" />We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
<verse eID="Acts.23.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.10" osisID="Acts.23.10" n="10" />And when there arose a great dissension, the officer, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the fortress.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.23.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.11" osisID="Acts.23.11" n="11" />And on the following night, the Lord stood by him, and said: Take courage; for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you testify also in Rome.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.23.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.12" osisID="Acts.23.12" n="12" />And when it was day, the Jews combined together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.23.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.13" osisID="Acts.23.13" n="13" />And there were more than forty who formed this conspiracy.
<verse eID="Acts.23.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.14" osisID="Acts.23.14" n="14" />And they went to the chief priests and elders, and said: We have surely bound ourselves under a curse, that we will taste nothing till we have killed Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.23.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.15" osisID="Acts.23.15" n="15" />Now, therefore, do you, together with the Sanhedrim, give notice to the officer, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as if you intended to inquire more accurately into the matters concerning him: and before he comes near, we are ready to kill him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.23.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.16" osisID="Acts.23.16" n="16" />But the son of Paul’s sister heard of the plot, and he went and entered the fortress, and told Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.23.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.17" osisID="Acts.23.17" n="17" />And Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said: Conduct this young man to the officer, for he has something to tell him.
<verse eID="Acts.23.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.18" osisID="Acts.23.18" n="18" />So he took him, and led him to the officer, and said: The prisoner Paul called me to him, and requested me to conduct this young man to you; for he has something to tell you.
<verse eID="Acts.23.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.19" osisID="Acts.23.19" n="19" />And the officer took him by the hand, and went aside with him privately, and inquired: What is it that you have to tell me?
<verse eID="Acts.23.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.20" osisID="Acts.23.20" n="20" />He answered: The Jews have agreed to request you to bring Paul down into the Sanhedrim to-morrow, as if they intended to inquire something more accurately concerning him.
<verse eID="Acts.23.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.21" osisID="Acts.23.21" n="21" />Do not, however, be persuaded by them; for more than forty men of them are lying in wait for him; and they have bound themselves under a curse, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for a promise from you.
<verse eID="Acts.23.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.22" osisID="Acts.23.22" n="22" />Then the officer sent the young man away, with this charge: Tell no one that you have made these things known to me.

<verse eID="Acts.23.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.23" osisID="Acts.23.23" n="23" />And he called to him two centurions, and said: Make ready two hundred soldiers, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, that they may depart to Cæsarea at the third hour of the night.
<verse eID="Acts.23.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.24" osisID="Acts.23.24" n="24" />And provide beasts on which they may set Paul, and take him in safety to Felix the governor.
<verse eID="Acts.23.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.25" osisID="Acts.23.25" n="25" />And he wrote a letter in this form:

<verse sID="Acts.23.26" osisID="Acts.23.26" n="26" />Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor, Felix, greeting:
<verse eID="Acts.23.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.27" osisID="Acts.23.27" n="27" />This man was taken by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them. Then I went with soldiers, and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
<verse eID="Acts.23.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.28" osisID="Acts.23.28" n="28" />But wishing to know the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down into their Sanhedrim.
<verse eID="Acts.23.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.29" osisID="Acts.23.29" n="29" />And I found that he was accused about questions of their law, but had nothing worthy of death or of bonds charged against him.
<verse eID="Acts.23.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.30" osisID="Acts.23.30" n="30" />And as I was informed that a plot was about to be laid against the man by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, and commanded his accusers to say in your presence what they had against him. Farewell.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.23.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.31" osisID="Acts.23.31" n="31" />Then the soldiers took Paul, as they were commanded, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
<verse eID="Acts.23.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.32" osisID="Acts.23.32" n="32" />And, on the morrow, they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the fortress.
<verse eID="Acts.23.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.33" osisID="Acts.23.33" n="33" />When they came to Cæsarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.
<verse eID="Acts.23.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.23.34" osisID="Acts.23.34" n="34" />And when he had read the letter, he inquired to what province he belonged. And learning that he was from Cilicia, he said: I will hear you when your accusers also have come. And he ordered him to be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.

<verse eID="Acts.24.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.2" osisID="Acts.24.2" n="2" />And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:
<verse eID="Acts.24.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.3" osisID="Acts.24.3" n="3" />Since through you we enjoy great quietness, and since whatever has been undertaken for this nation has been conducted to a successful issue by your foresight at all times and in all places, we accept it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
<verse eID="Acts.24.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.4" osisID="Acts.24.4" n="4" />But that I may not detain you longer, I beseech you to hear us, in your clemency, a few words.
<verse eID="Acts.24.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.5" osisID="Acts.24.5" n="5" />For we have found this man a pest and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
<verse eID="Acts.24.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.6" osisID="Acts.24.6" n="6" />He also attempted to profane the temple; and we took him, and wished to judge him according to our law.
<verse eID="Acts.24.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.7" osisID="Acts.24.7" n="7" />But Lysias the officer came, and, with much violence, took him out of our hands,
<verse eID="Acts.24.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.8" osisID="Acts.24.8" n="8" />and commanded his accusers to come before you. From him you may be able yourself, by examination, to gain a knowledge of all these tilings of which we accuse him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.24.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.9" osisID="Acts.24.9" n="9" />And the Jews united in accusing him, saying that these things were so.

<verse eID="Acts.24.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.10" osisID="Acts.24.10" n="10" />Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: Knowing that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully offer a defense for myself:
<verse eID="Acts.24.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.11" osisID="Acts.24.11" n="11" />for you can understand that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
<verse eID="Acts.24.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.12" osisID="Acts.24.12" n="12" />And they found me neither disputing with any one in the temple, nor exciting the multitude in the synagogue, or in the city:
<verse eID="Acts.24.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.13" osisID="Acts.24.13" n="13" />nor are they able to prove the things of which they now accuse me.
<verse eID="Acts.24.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.14" osisID="Acts.24.14" n="14" />But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call sect, so do I worship the God of my fathers; believing all things that are written in the law and in the prophets;
<verse eID="Acts.24.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.15" osisID="Acts.24.15" n="15" />having hope in God, which they themselves also admit, that I there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.
<verse eID="Acts.24.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.16" osisID="Acts.24.16" n="16" />And I do exercise myself in this, always to have a conscience void of offense toward God and man.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.24.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.17" osisID="Acts.24.17" n="17" />But, after many years, I came to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and offerings.
<verse eID="Acts.24.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.18" osisID="Acts.24.18" n="18" />While engaged in these things, certain Jews from Asia found me fulfilling my vow of abstinence in the temple, not with a multitude, nor with tumult.
<verse eID="Acts.24.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.19" osisID="Acts.24.19" n="19" />These ought to be here before you, and bring their charge, if they have any, against me.
<verse eID="Acts.24.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.20" osisID="Acts.24.20" n="20" />Or let these persons here say, what offensive conduct they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrim,
<verse eID="Acts.24.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.21" osisID="Acts.24.21" n="21" />except in this one expression, which I uttered while standing among them: With respect to the resurrection I of the dead, I am judged by you this day.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.24.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.22" osisID="Acts.24.22" n="22" />But Felix, having a more accurate knowledge of this way, put them off, and said: When Lysias the officer comes down, I will inquire fully into your matters.
<verse eID="Acts.24.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.23" osisID="Acts.24.23" n="23" />And he commanded the centurion to keep him under guard, and to relax the rigor of his confinement, and to forbid no one of his friends to minister or to come to him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.24.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.24" osisID="Acts.24.24" n="24" />And, after some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess; and he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
<verse eID="Acts.24.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.25" osisID="Acts.24.25" n="25" />And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered: For the present withdraw; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.
<verse eID="Acts.24.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.26" osisID="Acts.24.26" n="26" />He hoped, at the same time, that money would have been given him by Paul, to release him. For this reason, he sent for him very frequently, and conversed with him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.24.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.24.27" osisID="Acts.24.27" n="27" />But, after two years, Felix received Portius Festus as his successor; and Felix, wishing to confer a favor on the Jews, left Paul bound.

<chapter sID="Acts.25" osisID="Acts.25" n="25" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.1" osisID="Acts.25.1" n="1" />When Festus, having entered upon his government, after three days went up from Cæsarea to Jerusalem.
<verse eID="Acts.25.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.2" osisID="Acts.25.2" n="2" />And the chief priest and first men of the Jews informed him against Paul,
<verse eID="Acts.25.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.3" osisID="Acts.25.3" n="3" />and, asking a favor against him, besought him that he would send and have him brought to Jerusalem, laying a plot to kill him on the road.
<verse eID="Acts.25.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.4" osisID="Acts.25.4" n="4" />Then Festus answered, that Paul was under guard in Cæsarea, and that he himself would soon depart thither.
<verse eID="Acts.25.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.5" osisID="Acts.25.5" n="5" />Therefore, said he, let those among you who are men of influence, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there is any wickedness in him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.25.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.6" osisID="Acts.25.6" n="6" />And he remained among them not more than eight or ten days, and then went down to Cæsarea And, on the next day, he sat upon the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.
<verse eID="Acts.25.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.7" osisID="Acts.25.7" n="7" />And when he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around, and brought many and heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove,
<verse eID="Acts.25.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.8" osisID="Acts.25.8" n="8" />he answering for himself: Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cæsar, have I committed any offense.
<verse eID="Acts.25.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.9" osisID="Acts.25.9" n="9" />But Festus, willing to confer a favor on the Jews, answered Paul, and said: Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me concerning these things?
<verse eID="Acts.25.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.10" osisID="Acts.25.10" n="10" />And Paul answered: I am standing at the judgment-seat of Cæsar, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.
<verse eID="Acts.25.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.11" osisID="Acts.25.11" n="11" />If, however, I be an offender, and have done any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if the things of which these men accuse me are nothing, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Cæsar.
<verse eID="Acts.25.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.12" osisID="Acts.25.12" n="12" />Then Festus, after conferring with the council, answered: To Cæsar have you appealed? To Cæsar you shall go.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.25.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.13" osisID="Acts.25.13" n="13" />And after some days, King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Cæsarea, to salute Festus.
<verse eID="Acts.25.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.14" osisID="Acts.25.14" n="14" />And as they remained there many days, Festus made known to the king the facts concerning Paul, saying: There is a certain man, who was left in bonds by Felix,
<verse eID="Acts.25.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.15" osisID="Acts.25.15" n="15" />concerning whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews informed me, asking for judgment against him.
<verse eID="Acts.25.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.16" osisID="Acts.25.16" n="16" />I replied to them, that it is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man up to death, before the accused has had his accusers face to face, and has had an opportunity to answer concerning the charge that is against him.
<verse eID="Acts.25.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.17" osisID="Acts.25.17" n="17" />Therefore, when they had come hither with me, I made no delay; but, on the next day, sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
<verse eID="Acts.25.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.18" osisID="Acts.25.18" n="18" />And when his accusers stood up, they brought no such charge against him as I expected;
<verse eID="Acts.25.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.19" osisID="Acts.25.19" n="19" />but they had certain questions against him, about their own religion, and about a certain Jesus that had died, who, Paul affirmed, was alive.
<verse eID="Acts.25.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.20" osisID="Acts.25.20" n="20" />But, being in doubt about the question concerning this man, I asked him if he would go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged with respect to these matters.
<verse eID="Acts.25.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.21" osisID="Acts.25.21" n="21" />But when Paul made his appeal, that he should be kept for the judgment of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I could send him to Cæsar
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.25.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.22" osisID="Acts.25.22" n="22" />And Agrippa said to Festus: I could wish to have heard the man myself. He replied: To-morrow you shall hear him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.25.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.23" osisID="Acts.25.23" n="23" />Therefore, on the morrow, when Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and entered the place of audience, with the officers and principal men of the city, Paul, at the command of Festus, was brought forth.
<verse eID="Acts.25.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.24" osisID="Acts.25.24" n="24" />And Festus said: King Agrippa, and all men here present, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews, both in Jerusalem and in this place, have entreated me, crying out, that he ought to live no longer.
<verse eID="Acts.25.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.25" osisID="Acts.25.25" n="25" />But finding that he had done nothing worthy of death, and as he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
<verse eID="Acts.25.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.26" osisID="Acts.25.26" n="26" />Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. For this reason, I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after the examination has been held, I may have something to write.
<verse eID="Acts.25.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.25.27" osisID="Acts.25.27" n="27" />For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to make known the charges that are against him.

<verse sID="Acts.26.1" osisID="Acts.26.1" n="1" />Then Agrippa said to Paul: You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and answered for himself.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.26.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.2" osisID="Acts.26.2" n="2" />I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because I shall this day make my defense before you, concerning all things of which I am accused by the Jews;
<verse eID="Acts.26.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.3" osisID="Acts.26.3" n="3" />especially, since you are acquainted with all the customs and questions that are among the Jews. For this reason, I beseech you to hear me patiently.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.26.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.4" osisID="Acts.26.4" n="4" />My course of life from my youth, which, from the beginning, was among my own nation in Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
<verse eID="Acts.26.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.5" osisID="Acts.26.5" n="5" />who, knowing me from the first, could testify, if they would, that, according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.
<verse eID="Acts.26.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.6" osisID="Acts.26.6" n="6" />And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;
<verse eID="Acts.26.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.7" osisID="Acts.26.7" n="7" />to which promise our twelve tribes, zealously serving night and day, hope to come: on account of which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
<verse eID="Acts.26.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.8" osisID="Acts.26.8" n="8" />What? Is it thought a thing incredible among you, that God raises the dead?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.26.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.9" osisID="Acts.26.9" n="9" />I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus the Nazarene.
<verse eID="Acts.26.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.10" osisID="Acts.26.10" n="10" />And this I did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I gave my vote against them.
<verse eID="Acts.26.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.11" osisID="Acts.26.11" n="11" />And I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled them to speak impiously; and, being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.26.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.12" osisID="Acts.26.12" n="12" />While I was engaged in these things, and was going to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
<verse eID="Acts.26.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.13" osisID="Acts.26.13" n="13" />at midday, while I was on the road, I saw, O King, a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those who journeyed with me.
<verse eID="Acts.26.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.14" osisID="Acts.26.14" n="14" />And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying, in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
<verse eID="Acts.26.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.15" osisID="Acts.26.15" n="15" />And I said, Who art thou, Lord? He replied, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
<verse eID="Acts.26.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.16" osisID="Acts.26.16" n="16" />But arise, and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness of the things which you have seen, and of those in which I will appear to you,
<verse eID="Acts.26.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.17" osisID="Acts.26.17" n="17" />delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you,
<verse eID="Acts.26.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.18" osisID="Acts.26.18" n="18" />in order to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins, and an inheritance among the sanctified, by faith in me.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.26.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.19" osisID="Acts.26.19" n="19" />Wherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;
<verse eID="Acts.26.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.20" osisID="Acts.26.20" n="20" />but announced first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works worthy of repentance.
<verse eID="Acts.26.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.21" osisID="Acts.26.21" n="21" />For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple, and endeavored to kill me.
<verse eID="Acts.26.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.22" osisID="Acts.26.22" n="22" />Having, therefore, obtained help from God, I have stood till this day, testifying both to small and to great, saying nothing else than the things which the prophets and Moses did say should come to pass:
<verse eID="Acts.26.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.23" osisID="Acts.26.23" n="23" />that Christ should suffer, and that he first, by his resurrection from the dead, should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.26.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.24" osisID="Acts.26.24" n="24" />And as he spoke these things in his defense, Festus said, with a loud voice; Paul, you are mad; much learning drives you to madness.
<verse eID="Acts.26.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.25" osisID="Acts.26.25" n="25" />But he replied: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
<verse eID="Acts.26.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.26" osisID="Acts.26.26" n="26" />For the king has knowledge of these things, before whom, also, I speak with boldness; for I am persuaded that none of these things have escaped his notice; for this was not done in a corner.
<verse eID="Acts.26.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.27" osisID="Acts.26.27" n="27" />King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.
<verse eID="Acts.26.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.28" osisID="Acts.26.28" n="28" />Then Agrippa said to Paul: You almost persuade me to be a Christian.
<verse eID="Acts.26.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.29" osisID="Acts.26.29" n="29" />And Paul replied: I could pray to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me to-day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.26.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.30" osisID="Acts.26.30" n="30" />And the king arose, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.
<verse eID="Acts.26.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.31" osisID="Acts.26.31" n="31" />And when they had withdrawn, they conversed with one another, saying: This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
<verse eID="Acts.26.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.26.32" osisID="Acts.26.32" n="32" />And Agrippa said to Festus: This man could have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cæsar

<verse eID="Acts.27.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.2" osisID="Acts.27.2" n="2" />And going on board a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, intending to sail by the coast of Asia, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
<verse eID="Acts.27.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.3" osisID="Acts.27.3" n="3" />On the next day, we touched at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with kindness, and permitted him to go to his friends, and receive their attentions.
<verse eID="Acts.27.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.4" osisID="Acts.27.4" n="4" />And thence we put to sea, and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were adverse.
<verse eID="Acts.27.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.5" osisID="Acts.27.5" n="5" />And when we had sailed across the sea opposite Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.27.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.6" osisID="Acts.27.6" n="6" />And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy; and he put us on board.
<verse eID="Acts.27.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.7" osisID="Acts.27.7" n="7" />For many days we sailed slowly; and having with difficulty come off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to go further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, off Salmone:
<verse eID="Acts.27.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.8" osisID="Acts.27.8" n="8" />and coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which is the city of Lasea.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.27.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.9" osisID="Acts.27.9" n="9" />But, after much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous, for the fast was already past, Paul admonished them,
<verse eID="Acts.27.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.10" osisID="Acts.27.10" n="10" />saying: Men, I perceive that this voyage will be with damage and much loss, not only to the cargo and the ship, but also to our lives.
<verse eID="Acts.27.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.11" osisID="Acts.27.11" n="11" />But the centurion had more confidence in the pilot, and in the owner of the ship, than in the things which were spoken by Paul.
<verse eID="Acts.27.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.12" osisID="Acts.27.12" n="12" />And as the harbor was not commodious to winter in, the majority advised that they should put to sea from that place also, if, by any means, they might reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a harbor of Crete, lying toward the south-west and north-west.

<p>
<verse eID="Acts.27.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.13" osisID="Acts.27.13" n="13" />And when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had gained their object, they launched the ship, and ran along close to the shore of Crete.
<verse eID="Acts.27.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.14" osisID="Acts.27.14" n="14" />But in a little time a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon, blew against it.

<verse sID="Acts.27.17" osisID="Acts.27.17" n="17" />When they had taken it up, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they should fall into the quicksand, they lowered the mast, and thus were driven along.
<verse eID="Acts.27.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.18" osisID="Acts.27.18" n="18" />And as we were greatly tossed by the tempest, on the next day they threw overboard the cargo;

<verse eID="Acts.27.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.27" osisID="Acts.27.27" n="27" />But when the fourteenth night had come, and we were drifting up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors supposed that they were drawing near some land.
<verse eID="Acts.27.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.28" osisID="Acts.27.28" n="28" />And they sounded, and found twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, and sounded again, they found fifteen fathoms.
<verse eID="Acts.27.28" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.29" osisID="Acts.27.29" n="29" />And fearing that we would fall upon rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern, and wished for day.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.27.29" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.30" osisID="Acts.27.30" n="30" />And as the sailors were attempting to flee from the ship, and were letting down the boat into the sea, under the pretext that they were about to let down anchors from the prow,
<verse eID="Acts.27.30" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.31" osisID="Acts.27.31" n="31" />Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers: Unless these remain in the ship, you can not be saved.
<verse eID="Acts.27.31" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.32" osisID="Acts.27.32" n="32" />Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.27.32" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.33" osisID="Acts.27.33" n="33" />And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food, saying: This is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense, and continued without food, having taken nothing.
<verse eID="Acts.27.33" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.34" osisID="Acts.27.34" n="34" />Wherefore, I exhort you to take food; for this will promote your safety. For not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.
<verse eID="Acts.27.34" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.35" osisID="Acts.27.35" n="35" />And when he had said this, he took bread, and gave thanks to God before them all, and broke, and began to eat.
<verse eID="Acts.27.35" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.36" osisID="Acts.27.36" n="36" />And all became cheerful, and also partook of food.
<verse eID="Acts.27.36" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.37" osisID="Acts.27.37" n="37" />And all of us that were in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six souls.
<verse eID="Acts.27.37" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.38" osisID="Acts.27.38" n="38" />When they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship by throwing the provisions into the sea.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.27.38" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.39" osisID="Acts.27.39" n="39" />And when it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they perceived an inlet, that had an accessible shore, into which they desired, if they could, to thrust the ship.
<verse eID="Acts.27.39" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.40" osisID="Acts.27.40" n="40" />And, after cutting away the anchors, they committed the ship to the sea, at the same time loosing the lashings of the rudders: and they set up the front sail to the wind, and kept the ship firmly toward the shore.
<verse eID="Acts.27.40" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.41" osisID="Acts.27.41" n="41" />And falling into a place where two currents met, they ran the ship aground, and the prow stuck fast, and remained immovable; but the stern was broken by the violence of the waves.
<verse eID="Acts.27.41" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.42" osisID="Acts.27.42" n="42" />The soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest some of them should swim out and escape.
<verse eID="Acts.27.42" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.43" osisID="Acts.27.43" n="43" />But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, to throw themselves into the sea first, and get to land;
<verse eID="Acts.27.43" />
<verse sID="Acts.27.44" osisID="Acts.27.44" n="44" />and then the rest, some on planks, and others on what could be taken from the ship. And thus it came to pass, that all got safe to land.

<verse sID="Acts.28.1" osisID="Acts.28.1" n="1" />And when they had saved themselves, they then learned that the island was called Melita.
<verse eID="Acts.28.1" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.2" osisID="Acts.28.2" n="2" />And the barbarians showed us no ordinary kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the rain which was falling, and because of the cold.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.28.2" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.3" osisID="Acts.28.3" n="3" />And when Paul had brought together a heap of brushwood, and laid it on the fire, a viper came out, by reason of the heat, and fastened itself on his hand.
<verse eID="Acts.28.3" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.4" osisID="Acts.28.4" n="4" />And when the barbarians saw the reptile hanging from his hand, they said to one another: This man is certainly a murderer, whom, although he has saved himself from the sea, justice does not permit to live.
<verse eID="Acts.28.4" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.5" osisID="Acts.28.5" n="5" />Then he shook the reptile from him into the fire, and suffered no harm.
<verse eID="Acts.28.5" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.6" osisID="Acts.28.6" n="6" />But they were expecting that he would become inflamed and swollen, or would suddenly fall down dead; yet, after expecting it for a long time, and seeing no harm befall him, they changed their mind, and said he was a god.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.28.6" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.7" osisID="Acts.28.7" n="7" />Among the estates about that place were those of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius, who took us to his house, and, for three days, entertained us kindly.
<verse eID="Acts.28.7" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.8" osisID="Acts.28.8" n="8" />And it happened that the father of Publius was lying sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul went in to him, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and restored him to health.
<verse eID="Acts.28.8" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.9" osisID="Acts.28.9" n="9" />Therefore, after this had been clone, the rest also in the island who had diseases, came and were cured.
<verse eID="Acts.28.9" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.10" osisID="Acts.28.10" n="10" />And they also honored us with many honors; and, when we put to sea, they supplied us with such things as we needed.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.28.10" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.11" osisID="Acts.28.11" n="11" />After three months we put to sea in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose sign was the Dioscuri.
<verse eID="Acts.28.11" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.12" osisID="Acts.28.12" n="12" />And we landed at Syracuse, and remained there three days:
<verse eID="Acts.28.12" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.13" osisID="Acts.28.13" n="13" />from which place, by coasting about, we came to Rhegium; and one day afterward, the south wind arose; and we came, on the next day, to Puteoli,
<verse eID="Acts.28.13" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.14" osisID="Acts.28.14" n="14" />where we found brethren, and were persuaded to remain with them seven days. And thus we went toward Home.
<verse eID="Acts.28.14" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.15" osisID="Acts.28.15" n="15" />And from this place, the brethren, having heard of us, came out as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns, to meet us. When Paul saw the brethren, he thanked God, and took courage.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.28.15" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.16" osisID="Acts.28.16" n="16" />When we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself, with a soldier that guarded him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.28.16" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.17" osisID="Acts.28.17" n="17" />And it came to pass, after three days, that he called together the chief men of the Jews; and when they had come, he said to them: Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
<verse eID="Acts.28.17" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.18" osisID="Acts.28.18" n="18" />They, after examination, would have released me, for they found no cause of death in me.
<verse eID="Acts.28.18" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.19" osisID="Acts.28.19" n="19" />But because the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Cæsar: not that I have any accusation to bring against my own nation.
<verse eID="Acts.28.19" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.20" osisID="Acts.28.20" n="20" />For this reason, I called for you, that I might see you and speak to you; for on account of the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.28.20" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.21" osisID="Acts.28.21" n="21" />And they said to him: We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor has any one of the brethren come, and reported or spoken any evil of you.
<verse eID="Acts.28.21" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.22" osisID="Acts.28.22" n="22" />But we think it right to hear from you what you think: for, as it respects this sect, we know that it is everywhere spoken against.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Acts.28.22" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.23" osisID="Acts.28.23" n="23" />And when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom, from morning till evening;, he earnestly testified, and set forth the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and from the prophets.
<verse eID="Acts.28.23" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.24" osisID="Acts.28.24" n="24" />And some believed the things that were spoken, and some believed not.
<verse eID="Acts.28.24" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.25" osisID="Acts.28.25" n="25" />And not agreeing among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak to our fathers by Isaiah the prophet,
<verse eID="Acts.28.25" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.26" osisID="Acts.28.26" n="26" />saying: Go to this people and say, You shall surely hear, but you will not understand; and you shall surely see, but you will not perceive.
<verse eID="Acts.28.26" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.27" osisID="Acts.28.27" n="27" />For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should turn, and I should restore them to health.
<verse eID="Acts.28.27" />
<verse sID="Acts.28.28" osisID="Acts.28.28" n="28" />Therefore, be it known to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.

<verse sID="Rom.1.1" osisID="Rom.1.1" n="1" />Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
<verse eID="Rom.1.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.2" osisID="Rom.1.2" n="2" />which he formerly promised through his prophets in the holy scriptures,
<verse eID="Rom.1.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.3" osisID="Rom.1.3" n="3" />concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the posterity of David according to the flesh,

<verse eID="Rom.1.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.5" osisID="Rom.1.5" n="5" />through whom we have received grace and apostleship, in order to the obedience of faith among all nations, for the honor of his name,

<verse sID="Rom.1.7" osisID="Rom.1.7" n="7" />to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.1.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.8" osisID="Rom.1.8" n="8" />First, I thank my God, through Jesus Christ, on account of you all, because your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
<verse eID="Rom.1.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.9" osisID="Rom.1.9" n="9" />For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that, without ceasing, I make mention of you,
<verse eID="Rom.1.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.10" osisID="Rom.1.10" n="10" />always in my prayers making request, that, if possible, I may at length have a prosperous journey, by the will of God to come to you.
<verse eID="Rom.1.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.11" osisID="Rom.1.11" n="11" />For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, in order that you may be established;
<verse eID="Rom.1.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.12" osisID="Rom.1.12" n="12" />that is, that I may both give and receive comfort, while I am among you, through our common faith.

<verse eID="Rom.1.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.14" osisID="Rom.1.14" n="14" />I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.
<verse eID="Rom.1.14" />

<verse eID="Rom.1.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.17" osisID="Rom.1.17" n="17" />For in it the righteousness of God by faith is revealed, in order to faith: as it is written, He that is justified by faith, shall live.

<verse eID="Rom.1.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.18" osisID="Rom.1.18" n="18" />For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who, by unrighteousness, restrain the truth.
<verse eID="Rom.1.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.19" osisID="Rom.1.19" n="19" />Because that which may be known of God, is manifest among them; for God has made it manifest to them,
<verse eID="Rom.1.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.20" osisID="Rom.1.20" n="20" />(for, since the creation of the world, his attributes, which are invisible, are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity,) that they may be without excuse;
<verse eID="Rom.1.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.21" osisID="Rom.1.21" n="21" />because, when they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, nor were they thankful; but they became perverse in their reasonings, and their wicked heart was darkened;
<verse eID="Rom.1.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.22" osisID="Rom.1.22" n="22" />professing to be wise, they became foolish,
<verse eID="Rom.1.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.23" osisID="Rom.1.23" n="23" />and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image like corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.

<p>
<verse eID="Rom.1.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.24" osisID="Rom.1.24" n="24" />For which reason God delivered them up, in the desires of their hearts, to uncleanness, that they might dishonor their bodies among themselves;

<verse sID="Rom.1.25" osisID="Rom.1.25" n="25" />who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
<verse eID="Rom.1.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.26" osisID="Rom.1.26" n="26" />For this reason, God delivered them over to vile passions: for their females exchanged their natural use for that which is against nature:
<verse eID="Rom.1.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.27" osisID="Rom.1.27" n="27" />and in like manner also the males, leaving the natural use of the females, burned in their lusts one toward another, males with males practicing infamous lewdness, and receiving in themselves the due reward of their error.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.1.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.1.28" osisID="Rom.1.28" n="28" />And as they refused to acknowledge God, God delivered them up to an undiscerning mind, to do detestable things;

<verse sID="Rom.2.20" osisID="Rom.2.20" n="20" />an instructor of the simple, a teacher of the unlearned, because you have the form of true knowledge in the law;

<verse sID="Rom.2.27" osisID="Rom.2.27" n="27" />And shall not he whose want of circumcision is owing to his birth, if he keeps the law, condemn you, who, by the literal circumcision, transgress the law?
<verse eID="Rom.2.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.28" osisID="Rom.2.28" n="28" />For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:
<verse eID="Rom.2.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.2.29" osisID="Rom.2.29" n="29" />but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.

<verse eID="Rom.3.1" />

<verse sID="Rom.3.4" osisID="Rom.3.4" n="4" />It can not be. But let God be true, though every man be a liar, as it is written: That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

<p>
<verse eID="Rom.3.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.5" osisID="Rom.3.5" n="5" />But if our unrighteousness causes the righteousness of God to be better known, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous, who inflicts punishment? I speak as a man.

</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.3.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.3.8" osisID="Rom.3.8" n="8" />Then, why not say, (as we are slanderously reported as saying, and, as some affirm, that we do say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? Of such persons the condemnation is just.

<verse eID="Rom.4.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.2" osisID="Rom.4.2" n="2" />For if Abraham was justified by works, he has cause for boasting, but not before God.
<verse eID="Rom.4.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.3" osisID="Rom.4.3" n="3" />For what says the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.4.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.4" osisID="Rom.4.4" n="4" />Now to him that works, the reward is not counted as a favor, but as a debt:
<verse eID="Rom.4.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.5" osisID="Rom.4.5" n="5" />but to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.4.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.6" osisID="Rom.4.6" n="6" />Even as David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God counts righteousness without works, saying:
<verse eID="Rom.4.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.7" osisID="Rom.4.7" n="7" />Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
<verse eID="Rom.4.7" />

<p>
<verse eID="Rom.4.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.10" osisID="Rom.4.10" n="10" />Under what circumstances, then, was it counted? After he was circumcised? Or, while he was uncircumcised? Not after he was circumcised, but while he was uncircumcised.
<verse eID="Rom.4.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.11" osisID="Rom.4.11" n="11" />And he received the sign of circumcision, as a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had while he was uncircumcised, in order that he might be the father of all that believe, even in a state of uncircumcision, so that righteousness might be counted to them also;
<verse eID="Rom.4.11" />

<p>
<verse eID="Rom.4.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.13" osisID="Rom.4.13" n="13" />For the promise that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, nor to his posterity, through law, but through the righteousness of faith.
<verse eID="Rom.4.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.14" osisID="Rom.4.14" n="14" />For if they that are of the law be heirs, the faith is made powerless, and the promise is unmeaning;
<verse eID="Rom.4.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.15" osisID="Rom.4.15" n="15" />for the law inflicts punishment; for where no law is, there is no transgression.
<verse eID="Rom.4.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.16" osisID="Rom.4.16" n="16" />Therefore, the inheritance is by faith, that it may be according to grace, in order that the promise may be sure to all his posterity, not to those only who are of the law, but to those, also, who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
<verse eID="Rom.4.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.17" osisID="Rom.4.17" n="17" />(as it is written: I have made you a father of many nations,) in the sight of him in whom he believed, even God, who makes the dead alive, and calls those things which are not, as though they were.

<verse sID="Rom.4.19" osisID="Rom.4.19" n="19" />And not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body, which was already dead, (for he was about a hundred years old,) nor the deadness of Sarah’s womb;
<verse eID="Rom.4.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.4.20" osisID="Rom.4.20" n="20" />and he doubted not, through unbelief, with respect to the promise of God, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God,

<verse sID="Rom.5.6" osisID="Rom.5.6" n="6" />For when we were yet without strength, at the appointed time, Christ died for the ungodly.

<verse sID="Rom.5.7" osisID="Rom.5.7" n="7" />For hardly, indeed, will one die for a just man; yet, perhaps, for the good man some one would even dare to die.
<verse eID="Rom.5.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.8" osisID="Rom.5.8" n="8" />But God makes known his love to us in this, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us:
<verse eID="Rom.5.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.9" osisID="Rom.5.9" n="9" />much more, then, since we are now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath through him.

<verse sID="Rom.5.11" osisID="Rom.5.11" n="11" />And not only so, but we rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.5.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.12" osisID="Rom.5.12" n="12" />For this reason, as by one man sin entered into the world, and by his sin, death; and so death passed through to all men, because all have sinned:
<verse eID="Rom.5.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.13" osisID="Rom.5.13" n="13" />for till the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged where there is no law.
<verse eID="Rom.5.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.14" osisID="Rom.5.14" n="14" />Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that did not sin in the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is the type of him that was to come.
<verse eID="Rom.5.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.15" osisID="Rom.5.15" n="15" />But the favor bestowed is not, in all respects, like the offense: for if, by the offense of one, the many have died, much more have the grace of God and the gift which is by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ, been made abundant for the many.
<verse eID="Rom.5.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.16" osisID="Rom.5.16" n="16" />And the gift is not like the sentence that came through one who sinned: for the sentence to condemnation was because of one offense; but the favor bestowed in order to justification, is because of many offenses.
<verse eID="Rom.5.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.17" osisID="Rom.5.17" n="17" />For if, by one man’s offense, death has reigned through that one, much more shall those who receive the abundance of the grace, and of the gift of righteousness, reign in life through the one, who is Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Rom.5.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.18" osisID="Rom.5.18" n="18" />Therefore, as, by one offense, sentence came on all men to condemnation, so, also, by one act of righteousness, the gift has come on all men to justification of life.
<verse eID="Rom.5.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.19" osisID="Rom.5.19" n="19" />For as by the disobedience of the one man the many have been made sinners, so, also, by the obedience of the one, the many shall be made righteous.

<verse eID="Rom.5.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.5.20" osisID="Rom.5.20" n="20" />But, besides the first offense, law was introduced, in order that offenses might abound: but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:

<verse sID="Rom.6.20" osisID="Rom.6.20" n="20" />For when you were the servants of sin, you were free with respect to righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.6.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.21" osisID="Rom.6.21" n="21" />What fruit, therefore, had you at that time, in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
<verse eID="Rom.6.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.22" osisID="Rom.6.22" n="22" />But now, since you have been made free from sin, and have become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, eternal life.
<verse eID="Rom.6.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.6.23" osisID="Rom.6.23" n="23" />For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

<verse sID="Rom.7.1" osisID="Rom.7.1" n="1" />Know you not, brethren, for I speak to you that are acquainted with law, that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?
<verse eID="Rom.7.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.2" osisID="Rom.7.2" n="2" />For the woman that has a husband, is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives: but if her husband die, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
<verse eID="Rom.7.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.3" osisID="Rom.7.3" n="3" />So then, if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if her husband die, she is free from the law; so that she is not an adulteress, though she be married to another man.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.7.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.4" osisID="Rom.7.4" n="4" />So then, my brethren, you, also, have died to the law, by the body of the Christ, in order that you may be married to another, to him who was raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit to God.
<verse eID="Rom.7.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.5" osisID="Rom.7.5" n="5" />For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were excited by the law, were active in our members, so as to bring forth fruit to death:
<verse eID="Rom.7.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.6" osisID="Rom.7.6" n="6" />but now we are made free from the law, being dead to that by which we were bound, so that we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.7.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.7" osisID="Rom.7.7" n="7" />What, then, shall we say? Is the law sin? It can not be. Indeed, I had not known sin, except through law. For I had not known evil desire, unless the law had said: You shall not have any evil desire.
<verse eID="Rom.7.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.8" osisID="Rom.7.8" n="8" />But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, rendered active within me every evil desire. For without the law, sin was dead.
<verse eID="Rom.7.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.9" osisID="Rom.7.9" n="9" />Indeed, I was alive without the law, once; but when the commandment came, sin became alive, and I died:
<verse eID="Rom.7.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.10" osisID="Rom.7.10" n="10" />and the commandment, which was given for life, I found to be for death.
<verse eID="Rom.7.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.11" osisID="Rom.7.11" n="11" />For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
<verse eID="Rom.7.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.12" osisID="Rom.7.12" n="12" />Therefore, the law is holy, and the commandment, holy and just and good.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.7.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.13" osisID="Rom.7.13" n="13" />Has, then, that which is good become death to me? It can not be. But sin, that it, might appear sin, was causing death to me through that which is good, in order that sin, through the commandment, might become exceedingly sinful.
<verse eID="Rom.7.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.14" osisID="Rom.7.14" n="14" />For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold into bondage to sin.
<verse eID="Rom.7.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.15" osisID="Rom.7.15" n="15" />For what I do, I know not: for that which I wish to do, this I do not; but that which I hate, this I do.
<verse eID="Rom.7.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.16" osisID="Rom.7.16" n="16" />If, then, I do that which I wish not to do, I give assent to the law, that it is good.
<verse eID="Rom.7.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.17" osisID="Rom.7.17" n="17" />Now, then, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
<verse eID="Rom.7.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.18" osisID="Rom.7.18" n="18" />For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good; for to will is present with me; but to perform that which is good, I find not.
<verse eID="Rom.7.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.19" osisID="Rom.7.19" n="19" />For the good that I wish to do, I do not; but the evil that I wish not to do, this I do.
<verse eID="Rom.7.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.20" osisID="Rom.7.20" n="20" />Now, if I do that which I wish not to do, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.7.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.21" osisID="Rom.7.21" n="21" />I find, then, this law: That, when I wish to do good, evil is present with me.
<verse eID="Rom.7.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.22" osisID="Rom.7.22" n="22" />For, in the inward man, I delight in the law of God:
<verse eID="Rom.7.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.23" osisID="Rom.7.23" n="23" />but I perceive another law in my members, at war with the law of my mind, and making me a captive to the law of sin, which is in my members.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.7.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.24" osisID="Rom.7.24" n="24" />Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body that subjects me to death?
<verse eID="Rom.7.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.7.25" osisID="Rom.7.25" n="25" />I thank God that I shall be delivered through Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind, serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin.

<verse eID="Rom.8.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.2" osisID="Rom.8.2" n="2" />For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin, and of death.
<verse eID="Rom.8.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.3" osisID="Rom.8.3" n="3" />For what the law could not do, because it was weak through the flesh, God has done, who, sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for a sin-offering, condemned sin in the flesh,
<verse eID="Rom.8.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.4" osisID="Rom.8.4" n="4" />that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.

<p>
<verse eID="Rom.8.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.5" osisID="Rom.8.5" n="5" />For those who are according to the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
<verse eID="Rom.8.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.6" osisID="Rom.8.6" n="6" />For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace.
<verse eID="Rom.8.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.7" osisID="Rom.8.7" n="7" />Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can it be.
<verse eID="Rom.8.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.8" osisID="Rom.8.8" n="8" />Those, then, who are in the flesh, can not please God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.8.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.9" osisID="Rom.8.9" n="9" />But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now, if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.
<verse eID="Rom.8.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.10" osisID="Rom.8.10" n="10" />But if Christ is in you, the body is dead, on account of sin, but the Spirit is life, on account of righteousness.
<verse eID="Rom.8.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.11" osisID="Rom.8.11" n="11" />And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised the Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwells in you.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.8.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.12" osisID="Rom.8.12" n="12" />Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh;
<verse eID="Rom.8.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.13" osisID="Rom.8.13" n="13" />for if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if, through the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, you shall live.
<verse eID="Rom.8.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.14" osisID="Rom.8.14" n="14" />For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
<verse eID="Rom.8.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.15" osisID="Rom.8.15" n="15" />For you have not again received the spirit of bondage, that you may fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.
<verse eID="Rom.8.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.16" osisID="Rom.8.16" n="16" />The Spirit itself testifies with our spirit, that we are the children of God;
<verse eID="Rom.8.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.17" osisID="Rom.8.17" n="17" />and, if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified together.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.8.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.18" osisID="Rom.8.18" n="18" />For I consider the sufferings of the present time not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed for us.
<verse eID="Rom.8.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.19" osisID="Rom.8.19" n="19" />For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the revelation of the sons of God.
<verse eID="Rom.8.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.20" osisID="Rom.8.20" n="20" />For the creature was subject to frailty, (not by its own will, but for his sake who subjected it,)
<verse eID="Rom.8.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.21" osisID="Rom.8.21" n="21" />in hope, that even the creature itself shall be made free from the bondage of corruption, and introduced into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
<verse eID="Rom.8.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.22" osisID="Rom.8.22" n="22" />For we know that every creature groans, and is in pain together, till now:
<verse eID="Rom.8.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.23" osisID="Rom.8.23" n="23" />and not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.
<verse eID="Rom.8.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.24" osisID="Rom.8.24" n="24" />For we are saved by this hope; but hope that is seen is not hope; for, what any one sees, why does he also hope for it?
<verse eID="Rom.8.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.25" osisID="Rom.8.25" n="25" />But if we hope for that which we see not we wait for it with patience.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.8.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.26" osisID="Rom.8.26" n="26" />In like manner, also, the Spirit helps our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us, with groanings unutterable.
<verse eID="Rom.8.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.27" osisID="Rom.8.27" n="27" />And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, that he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

<p>
<verse eID="Rom.8.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.28" osisID="Rom.8.28" n="28" />And we know that all things work together for good, to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.
<verse eID="Rom.8.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.29" osisID="Rom.8.29" n="29" />For those whom he foreknew, he predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren:

<verse sID="Rom.8.30" osisID="Rom.8.30" n="30" />and those whom he predestinated he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.

<p>
<verse eID="Rom.8.30" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.31" osisID="Rom.8.31" n="31" />What, then, shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
<verse eID="Rom.8.31" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.32" osisID="Rom.8.32" n="32" />He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not with him also freely give us all things?
<verse eID="Rom.8.32" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.33" osisID="Rom.8.33" n="33" />Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifies.
<verse eID="Rom.8.33" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.34" osisID="Rom.8.34" n="34" />Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died: rather, indeed, that has risen, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
<verse eID="Rom.8.34" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.35" osisID="Rom.8.35" n="35" />Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? Shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword?
<verse eID="Rom.8.35" />
<verse sID="Rom.8.36" osisID="Rom.8.36" n="36" />As it is written: For thy sake, we are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.

<verse eID="Rom.9.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.2" osisID="Rom.9.2" n="2" />That I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart;

<verse sID="Rom.9.7" osisID="Rom.9.7" n="7" />Nor, because they are the posterity of Abraham, are they all children: but in Isaac shall your posterity be called.
<verse eID="Rom.9.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.8" osisID="Rom.9.8" n="8" />That is, the children of the flesh are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for the posterity.
<verse eID="Rom.9.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.9" osisID="Rom.9.9" n="9" />For the word of the promise is this: At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
<verse eID="Rom.9.9" />

<verse eID="Rom.9.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.12" osisID="Rom.9.12" n="12" />it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger;

<verse eID="Rom.9.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.16" osisID="Rom.9.16" n="16" />Therefore, it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.
<verse eID="Rom.9.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.17" osisID="Rom.9.17" n="17" />For the scripture says to Pharaoh: For this very purpose have I raised you up, that I may show in you my power, and that my name may be published in all the earth.
<verse eID="Rom.9.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.18" osisID="Rom.9.18" n="18" />Therefore, he has mercy on whom he wills to have mercy: and whom he wills to harden, he hardens.
</p>

<verse sID="Rom.9.19" osisID="Rom.9.19" n="19" />You will then say to me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?
<verse eID="Rom.9.19" />

<verse eID="Rom.9.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.23" osisID="Rom.9.23" n="23" />and, that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he before prepared for glory, showed mercy to us,
<verse eID="Rom.9.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.24" osisID="Rom.9.24" n="24" />whom he has called, not only from among the Jews, but also from the Gentiles?
<verse eID="Rom.9.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.25" osisID="Rom.9.25" n="25" />As he says also in Hosea: I will call that my people which is not my people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.
<verse eID="Rom.9.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.26" osisID="Rom.9.26" n="26" />And it shall come to pass, that, in the place where it was said to them: You are not my people, there shall they be called the sons of the living God.
<verse eID="Rom.9.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.27" osisID="Rom.9.27" n="27" />But Isaiah cries concerning Israel: Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
<verse eID="Rom.9.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.28" osisID="Rom.9.28" n="28" />for his word he fulfills, and he decrees in righteousness; for his word that is decreed, will the Lord execute upon the land.
<verse eID="Rom.9.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.29" osisID="Rom.9.29" n="29" />And as Isaiah said before: Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a posterity, we should have been like Sodom, and been made like Gomorrah.

<verse sID="Rom.9.31" osisID="Rom.9.31" n="31" />but Israel, who sought after a law of justification, has not attained to a law of justification.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.9.31" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.32" osisID="Rom.9.32" n="32" />And why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as if by works of law: for they stumbled against that stone of stumbling,
<verse eID="Rom.9.32" />
<verse sID="Rom.9.33" osisID="Rom.9.33" n="33" />as it is written: Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense: and whoever believes on him, shall not be ashamed.

<verse sID="Rom.10.4" osisID="Rom.10.4" n="4" />For Christ is the end of the law for justification, to every one that believes.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.10.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.5" osisID="Rom.10.5" n="5" />For Moses describes the justification which is by the law: That the man who does these things shall live by them.
<verse eID="Rom.10.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.6" osisID="Rom.10.6" n="6" />But the justification by faith speaks thus: Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down;
<verse eID="Rom.10.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.7" osisID="Rom.10.7" n="7" />or, Who shall descend into the abyss? that is, to bring Christ again from the dead.
<verse eID="Rom.10.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.8" osisID="Rom.10.8" n="8" />But what says it? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart; that is, the word of faith which we preach;
<verse eID="Rom.10.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.9" osisID="Rom.10.9" n="9" />that if you will confess with your mouth, that Jesus is Lord, and will believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.
<verse eID="Rom.10.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.10" osisID="Rom.10.10" n="10" />For with the heart we believe, in order to justification; and with the mouth we make confession, it order to salvation.
<verse eID="Rom.10.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.11" osisID="Rom.10.11" n="11" />For the scripture says: He that believes on him shall not be ashamed.
<verse eID="Rom.10.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.12" osisID="Rom.10.12" n="12" />For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all that call on him:
<verse eID="Rom.10.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.13" osisID="Rom.10.13" n="13" />For every one that calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.10.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.14" osisID="Rom.10.14" n="14" />How, then, shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?
<verse eID="Rom.10.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.15" osisID="Rom.10.15" n="15" />And how shall they preach, unless they be sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, who bring joyous news of good things!
<verse eID="Rom.10.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.16" osisID="Rom.10.16" n="16" />But they have not all obeyed the gospel; for Isaiah says: Lord, who has believed our report?
<verse eID="Rom.10.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.17" osisID="Rom.10.17" n="17" />So, then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
<verse eID="Rom.10.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.18" osisID="Rom.10.18" n="18" />But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily; their voice has gone forth into all the earth: and their words to the ends of the world.
<verse eID="Rom.10.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.19" osisID="Rom.10.19" n="19" />But I say: Did not Israel know? First, Moses says: I will excite you to jealousy by that which is no nation; and by a foolish nation I will provoke you to wrath.
<verse eID="Rom.10.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.20" osisID="Rom.10.20" n="20" />But Isaiah is very bold, and says: I was found by them that sought me not: I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.
<verse eID="Rom.10.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.10.21" osisID="Rom.10.21" n="21" />But with respect to Israel, he says: All day long have I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contradicting people.

<chapter sID="Rom.11" osisID="Rom.11" n="11" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.1" osisID="Rom.11.1" n="1" />I say, then, Has God rejected his people? It can not be. For I am an Israelite, of the posterity of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
<verse eID="Rom.11.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.2" osisID="Rom.11.2" n="2" />God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture says, in regard to Elijah? how he intercedes with God against Israel, saying:
<verse eID="Rom.11.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.3" osisID="Rom.11.3" n="3" />Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thy altars, and I am left alone, and they seek: my life.
<verse eID="Rom.11.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.4" osisID="Rom.11.4" n="4" />But what says the answer of God to him? I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
<verse eID="Rom.11.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.5" osisID="Rom.11.5" n="5" />Thus, then, at the present time also, there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
<verse eID="Rom.11.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.6" osisID="Rom.11.6" n="6" />And if the election is by grace, it is no longer by works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.11.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.7" osisID="Rom.11.7" n="7" />What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks; but the chosen have obtained it, and the rest have been hardened to this day,
<verse eID="Rom.11.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.8" osisID="Rom.11.8" n="8" />as it is written: God has given them a spirit of stupor, eyes with which they can not see, and ears with which they can not hear.
<verse eID="Rom.11.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.9" osisID="Rom.11.9" n="9" />And David says: Let their table become a trap, and a net, and a snare, and a recompense to them;
<verse eID="Rom.11.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.10" osisID="Rom.11.10" n="10" />let their eyes be darkened, so that they may not see, and let them bow down their back always.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.11.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.11" osisID="Rom.11.11" n="11" />I say, then, Have they stumbled, in order that they may fall? It can not be. But rather, through their fall, salvation has come to the Gentiles, to excite them to jealousy.
<verse eID="Rom.11.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.12" osisID="Rom.11.12" n="12" />Now, if their fall be the riches of the world, and their loss be the riches of the Gentiles, how much more shall their full acceptance <transChange type="added">be the riches of the world</transChange>?
<verse eID="Rom.11.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.13" osisID="Rom.11.13" n="13" />For I speak to you, Gentiles; inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I do honor to my ministry,
<verse eID="Rom.11.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.14" osisID="Rom.11.14" n="14" />if, by any means, I may excite to jealousy those who are my flesh, and save some of them.
<verse eID="Rom.11.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.15" osisID="Rom.11.15" n="15" />For, if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the reception of them be, but life from the dead?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.11.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.16" osisID="Rom.11.16" n="16" />Now, if the first fruit is holy, the mass is holy also: and if the root is holy, the branches are holy also.
<verse eID="Rom.11.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.17" osisID="Rom.11.17" n="17" />And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, have been grafted in among them, and partake with them of the root and fatness of the olive,
<verse eID="Rom.11.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.18" osisID="Rom.11.18" n="18" />boast not against the branches; but if you boast, boast not that you bear the root, but that the root bears you.
<verse eID="Rom.11.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.19" osisID="Rom.11.19" n="19" />You will say then: The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
<verse eID="Rom.11.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.20" osisID="Rom.11.20" n="20" />Well; on account of unbelief they were broken off; but you stand by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear.
<verse eID="Rom.11.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.21" osisID="Rom.11.21" n="21" />For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed, lest he spare not you.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.11.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.22" osisID="Rom.11.22" n="22" />Behold, then, the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell; severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise, you also shall be cut off.
<verse eID="Rom.11.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.23" osisID="Rom.11.23" n="23" />And they, also, if they continue not in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
<verse eID="Rom.11.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.24" osisID="Rom.11.24" n="24" />For if you were cut out from an olive-tree that is wild by nature, and were grafted, against nature, into a good olive, how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.11.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.25" osisID="Rom.11.25" n="25" />For I do not wish you, brethren, to be ignorant of this mystery―lest you be wise in your own conceit―that blindness has happened to Israel in part, till the full number of the Gentiles shall have come in.
<verse eID="Rom.11.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.26" osisID="Rom.11.26" n="26" />And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
<verse eID="Rom.11.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.27" osisID="Rom.11.27" n="27" />And this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.
<verse eID="Rom.11.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.28" osisID="Rom.11.28" n="28" />As it respects the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sakes; but as it respects their election, they are beloved for the fathers sakes:
<verse eID="Rom.11.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.29" osisID="Rom.11.29" n="29" />for God’s gifts and calling are irrevocable.
<verse eID="Rom.11.29" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.30" osisID="Rom.11.30" n="30" />For as you formerly did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy through their unbelief;
<verse eID="Rom.11.30" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.31" osisID="Rom.11.31" n="31" />so, also, these have not now believed, that through the mercy shown to you, they also may obtain mercy.
<verse eID="Rom.11.31" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.32" osisID="Rom.11.32" n="32" />For God has delivered them all over to unbelief, that he may have mercy on them all.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.11.32" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.33" osisID="Rom.11.33" n="33" />O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
<verse eID="Rom.11.33" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.34" osisID="Rom.11.34" n="34" />For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or, who has been his counsellor?
<verse eID="Rom.11.34" />
<verse sID="Rom.11.35" osisID="Rom.11.35" n="35" />Or, who has first given to him, and received from him a recompense?

<verse eID="Rom.12.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.2" osisID="Rom.12.2" n="2" />And be not conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may learn what the will of God is―the good, and the acceptable, and the perfect.

<p>
<verse eID="Rom.12.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.3" osisID="Rom.12.3" n="3" />For I say, through the grace given to me, to every one that is among you, that he must not think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but that he be disposed to think modestly, as God has distributed to each a measure of faith.
<verse eID="Rom.12.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.4" osisID="Rom.12.4" n="4" />For as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office,

<verse sID="Rom.12.6" osisID="Rom.12.6" n="6" />Since, then, we have gifts which differ according to the grace that is given to us, whether we have the gift of prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;
<verse eID="Rom.12.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.12.7" osisID="Rom.12.7" n="7" />or, if we have a ministry, let us be active in our ministry; if any one teaches, let him attend to his teaching;

<verse eID="Rom.13.1" />

<verse eID="Rom.13.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.13.3" osisID="Rom.13.3" n="3" />For rulers are not a terror to works that are good, but to those which are evil. Will you, then, not be afraid of the authority? Do that which is good, and you shall receive praise from the same.

<verse eID="Rom.13.9" />

<p>
<verse eID="Rom.14.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.13" osisID="Rom.14.13" n="13" />Let us, therefore, no longer judge one another: but rather decide to put no stumbling-block or snare in your brother’s way.
<verse eID="Rom.14.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.14" osisID="Rom.14.14" n="14" />I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself; but if any one thinks that any thing is unclean, to him it is unclean.
<verse eID="Rom.14.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.15" osisID="Rom.14.15" n="15" />But if your brother is grieved on account of your food, you no longer walk according to love. Do not, with your food, destroy him, for whom Christ died.
<verse eID="Rom.14.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.16" osisID="Rom.14.16" n="16" />Therefore, let not that which is your good be evil spoken of.
<verse eID="Rom.14.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.17" osisID="Rom.14.17" n="17" />For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.14.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.18" osisID="Rom.14.18" n="18" />For he who serves the Christ in these things is acceptable to God, and approved by men.
<verse eID="Rom.14.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.19" osisID="Rom.14.19" n="19" />Therefore, let us seek those things which belong to peace, and those which tend to mutual edification.
<verse eID="Rom.14.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.20" osisID="Rom.14.20" n="20" />Destroy not the work of God on account of food. All meats, indeed, are clean; but meat is an evil to that man who, by eating, causes another to stumble.
<verse eID="Rom.14.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.21" osisID="Rom.14.21" n="21" />It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do any thing by which your brother stumbles, or is ensnared, or is made weak.
<verse eID="Rom.14.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.22" osisID="Rom.14.22" n="22" />Have you faith? Have it to yourself before God. Blessed is he who condemns not himself in that which he approves.
<verse eID="Rom.14.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.14.23" osisID="Rom.14.23" n="23" />But he that doubts is condemned, if he eat, because he eats not with faith. Every thing that is not of faith, is sin.

<chapter sID="Rom.15" osisID="Rom.15" n="15" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.1" osisID="Rom.15.1" n="1" />But we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of those who are not strong, and not to please ourselves.
<verse eID="Rom.15.1" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.2" osisID="Rom.15.2" n="2" />Let each one of us please his neighbor in that which is good for his edification.
<verse eID="Rom.15.2" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.3" osisID="Rom.15.3" n="3" />For the Christ did not please himself; but as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell on me.
<verse eID="Rom.15.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.4" osisID="Rom.15.4" n="4" />For the things which were formerly written, were written for our instruction, that we, through the patience and the comfort which the scriptures give, might have hope.
<verse eID="Rom.15.4" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.5" osisID="Rom.15.5" n="5" />Now, may the God of patience and comfort make you of the same mind one toward another, according to Christ Jesus;
<verse eID="Rom.15.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.6" osisID="Rom.15.6" n="6" />that with one mind and with one voice you may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="Rom.15.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.7" osisID="Rom.15.7" n="7" />Wherefore, receive one another with kindness, as the Christ has received you, to the glory of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.15.7" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.8" osisID="Rom.15.8" n="8" />Now, I say, that Jesus Christ, as a minister, was of the circumcision for the sake of the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises made to the fathers,
<verse eID="Rom.15.8" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.9" osisID="Rom.15.9" n="9" />and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: For this cause I will give praise to thee among the Gentiles, and to thy name will I sing.
<verse eID="Rom.15.9" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.10" osisID="Rom.15.10" n="10" />And again he says: Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.
<verse eID="Rom.15.10" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.11" osisID="Rom.15.11" n="11" />And again: Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and applaud him all you peoples.
<verse eID="Rom.15.11" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.12" osisID="Rom.15.12" n="12" />And again, Isaiah says: There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to rule the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust.
<verse eID="Rom.15.12" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.13" osisID="Rom.15.13" n="13" />Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in the hope, by the power of the Holy Spirit.

<p>
<verse eID="Rom.15.13" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.14" osisID="Rom.15.14" n="14" />And I myself am persuaded concerning you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of all goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, able also to instruct one another.
<verse eID="Rom.15.14" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.15" osisID="Rom.15.15" n="15" />Yet I have written to you more boldly in part, my brethren, as if I would put you in remembrance, on account of the grace which is given to me by God,
<verse eID="Rom.15.15" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.16" osisID="Rom.15.16" n="16" />that I may be the public servant of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, officiating as a priest with respect to the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable, having been sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
<verse eID="Rom.15.16" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.17" osisID="Rom.15.17" n="17" />I have, therefore, cause to glory in Christ Jesus in things that pertain to God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.15.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.18" osisID="Rom.15.18" n="18" />For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not accomplished through me, by word and deed, in order to make the Gentiles obedient,
<verse eID="Rom.15.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.19" osisID="Rom.15.19" n="19" />by the power of signs and wonders by the power of the Holy Spirit. So that from Jerusalem, and round about as far as Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of the Christ;
<verse eID="Rom.15.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.20" osisID="Rom.15.20" n="20" />so earnestly desirous have I been to preach the gospel, not where Christ had been named, lest I should build on another man’s foundation;
<verse eID="Rom.15.20" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.21" osisID="Rom.15.21" n="21" />but, as it is written: They to whom he was not preached, shall see; and they who have not heard, shall understand.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.15.21" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.22" osisID="Rom.15.22" n="22" />For which reason, also, I have been often hindered from coming to you.
<verse eID="Rom.15.22" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.23" osisID="Rom.15.23" n="23" />But now, having no longer a place in these regions, and having had for many years a strong desire to come to you,
<verse eID="Rom.15.23" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.24" osisID="Rom.15.24" n="24" />when I make my journey into Spain, I hope, in passing through, to see you, and to be conducted by you on my journey thither, after I am first partly satisfied with your company.
<verse eID="Rom.15.24" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.25" osisID="Rom.15.25" n="25" />But now I am going to Jerusalem, to minister to the saints.
<verse eID="Rom.15.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.26" osisID="Rom.15.26" n="26" />For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor saints who are in Jerusalem:
<verse eID="Rom.15.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.27" osisID="Rom.15.27" n="27" />they have been pleased to do so, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have become partakers of their spiritual things, they ought to minister to them in things pertaining to the flesh.
<verse eID="Rom.15.27" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.28" osisID="Rom.15.28" n="28" />When, therefore, I shall have performed this, and have delivered to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain.
<verse eID="Rom.15.28" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.29" osisID="Rom.15.29" n="29" />And I know that in coming to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Rom.15.29" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.30" osisID="Rom.15.30" n="30" />Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me, in your prayers to God for me,
<verse eID="Rom.15.30" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.31" osisID="Rom.15.31" n="31" />that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that this service of mine, which is for Jerusalem, may be acceptable to the saints;
<verse eID="Rom.15.31" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.32" osisID="Rom.15.32" n="32" />that I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed among you.
<verse eID="Rom.15.32" />
<verse sID="Rom.15.33" osisID="Rom.15.33" n="33" />The God of peace be with you all. Amen.

<verse sID="Rom.16.2" osisID="Rom.16.2" n="2" />that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of saints, and that you aid her in whatever matter she may have need of you; for she has aided many, and myself also.

<verse eID="Rom.16.3" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.4" osisID="Rom.16.4" n="4" />who, for my life, laid down their own necks; to whom not only do I give thanks, but all the churches of the Gentiles:

<verse sID="Rom.16.5" osisID="Rom.16.5" n="5" />and salute the church that is in their house. Salute Epenetus my beloved, who is the first fruits of Asia to Christ.
<verse eID="Rom.16.5" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.6" osisID="Rom.16.6" n="6" />Salute Mary, who bestowed much labor on us.
<verse eID="Rom.16.6" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.7" osisID="Rom.16.7" n="7" />Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are noted among the apostles, who, also, were in Christ before me.
</p>

<p>

<verse sID="Rom.16.17" osisID="Rom.16.17" n="17" />Now I beseech you, brethren, to mark those who make divisions and cause offenses in opposition to the teaching which you have learned, and avoid them.
<verse eID="Rom.16.17" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.18" osisID="Rom.16.18" n="18" />For such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own appetites; and, by good words and fair speeches, they deceive the hearts of the simple.
<verse eID="Rom.16.18" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.19" osisID="Rom.16.19" n="19" />For your obedience has gone abroad to all men: I rejoice, therefore, on your account. But I desire you to be wise in respect to that which is good, and guileless in respect to that which is evil.
<verse eID="Rom.16.19" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.20" osisID="Rom.16.20" n="20" />The God of peace will soon bruise Satan under your feet.

<verse eID="Rom.16.25" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.26" osisID="Rom.16.26" n="26" />but is now made manifest, and through the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, made known among all nations for the obedience of faith,
<verse eID="Rom.16.26" />
<verse sID="Rom.16.27" osisID="Rom.16.27" n="27" />to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory throughout the ages. Amen.

<verse sID="1Cor.1.2" osisID="1Cor.1.2" n="2" />to the church of God which is in Corinth, to the sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
<verse eID="1Cor.1.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.3" osisID="1Cor.1.3" n="3" />grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

<verse eID="1Cor.1.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.5" osisID="1Cor.1.5" n="5" />that you are enriched by him in every thing, in all speech, and in all knowledge,
<verse eID="1Cor.1.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.6" osisID="1Cor.1.6" n="6" />even as the testimony concerning the Christ was con firmed among you,
<verse eID="1Cor.1.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.7" osisID="1Cor.1.7" n="7" />so that you are deficient in no gift, while waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<verse sID="1Cor.1.8" osisID="1Cor.1.8" n="8" />He also will establish you even to the end, and make you blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.9" osisID="1Cor.1.9" n="9" />God is faithful, by whom you have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.1.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.10" osisID="1Cor.1.10" n="10" />Now, I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you, but that you be perfectly united in the same mind, and in the same judgment.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.11" osisID="1Cor.1.11" n="11" />For it has been made known to me concerning you, my brethren, by the family of Cloe, that there are contentions among you.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.12" osisID="1Cor.1.12" n="12" />I mean this: that each one of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.1.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.13" osisID="1Cor.1.13" n="13" />Is the Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? or were you immersed into the name of Paul?
<verse eID="1Cor.1.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.14" osisID="1Cor.1.14" n="14" />I thank God that I immersed none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
<verse eID="1Cor.1.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.15" osisID="1Cor.1.15" n="15" />that no one may say that I immersed into my own name.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.16" osisID="1Cor.1.16" n="16" />I did, indeed, immerse the household of Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I immersed any other.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.17" osisID="1Cor.1.17" n="17" />For Christ sent me not to immerse, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of speech, lest the cross of the Christ should be deprived of its power.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.18" osisID="1Cor.1.18" n="18" />For the preaching of the cross is to those who perish, foolishness; but to us who are saved, it is the power of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.19" osisID="1Cor.1.19" n="19" />For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; and I will set aside the understanding of the prudent.

<verse sID="1Cor.1.20" osisID="1Cor.1.20" n="20" />Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
<verse eID="1Cor.1.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.21" osisID="1Cor.1.21" n="21" />For, since in the wisdom of God, the world, by its wisdom, knew not God, it has pleased God, through the foolishness of what is preached, to save those who believe.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.22" osisID="1Cor.1.22" n="22" />For the Jews ask for a sign, and the Greeks seek for wisdom;
<verse eID="1Cor.1.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.23" osisID="1Cor.1.23" n="23" />but we preach Christ crucified; to the Jews, indeed, a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks, foolishness:
<verse eID="1Cor.1.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.24" osisID="1Cor.1.24" n="24" />but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.25" osisID="1Cor.1.25" n="25" />For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.1.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.26" osisID="1Cor.1.26" n="26" />For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise men according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble call you;
<verse eID="1Cor.1.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.27" osisID="1Cor.1.27" n="27" />but God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may bring to shame the wise; and the weak things of the world has God chosen, that he may put to shame the strong;
<verse eID="1Cor.1.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.28" osisID="1Cor.1.28" n="28" />and the ignoble things of the world, and the things that are despised, has God chosen, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are;
<verse eID="1Cor.1.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.29" osisID="1Cor.1.29" n="29" />that no flesh should glory in his presence.
<verse eID="1Cor.1.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.1.30" osisID="1Cor.1.30" n="30" />But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who has become to us, from God, wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;
<verse eID="1Cor.1.30" />

<verse sID="1Cor.7.8" osisID="1Cor.7.8" n="8" />But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It would be good for them, if they remain as I myself.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.9" osisID="1Cor.7.9" n="9" />But if they can not be continent, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.10" osisID="1Cor.7.10" n="10" />But to the married I give commandment, not I, but the Lord: Let not the wife leave her husband:
<verse eID="1Cor.7.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.11" osisID="1Cor.7.11" n="11" />but if she leave him, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and, let not the husband put away his wife.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.7.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.12" osisID="1Cor.7.12" n="12" />But to the rest, I, and not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she is well pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.13" osisID="1Cor.7.13" n="13" />And if any woman has a husband that believes not, and he is well pleased to dwell with her, let her not put him away.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.14" osisID="1Cor.7.14" n="14" />For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; for if not, then are your children unclean; but now they are holy.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.15" osisID="1Cor.7.15" n="15" />But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart; the brother or sister is not bound in such cases. But God has called us to live in peace.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.16" osisID="1Cor.7.16" n="16" />For how do you know, O wife, but that you may save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, but that you may save your wife?
<verse eID="1Cor.7.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.17" osisID="1Cor.7.17" n="17" />But as God has assigned a place to every one, as the Lord has called every one, so let him continue to live: and so do I command in all the churches.

<verse eID="1Cor.7.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.18" osisID="1Cor.7.18" n="18" />Has any one been called that had been circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the mark of circumcision. Has any one been called that had not been circumcised? Let him not be circumcised,
<verse eID="1Cor.7.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.19" osisID="1Cor.7.19" n="19" />Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God is our aim.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.20" osisID="1Cor.7.20" n="20" />Let every one remain in that condition in which he was, when called.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.21" osisID="1Cor.7.21" n="21" />Were you a servant when you were called? Care not for it. But if you can become free, rather enjoy your freedom.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.22" osisID="1Cor.7.22" n="22" />For he that is in the Lord, having been called when a servant, is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise, also, the freeman who has been called, is Christ’s servant.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.23" osisID="1Cor.7.23" n="23" />You have been bought with a price; become not the servants of men.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.24" osisID="1Cor.7.24" n="24" />Brethren, let every one, in whatever condition he is called, abide in this with God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.7.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.25" osisID="1Cor.7.25" n="25" />But with respect to virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment as one that is enabled, by the mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.26" osisID="1Cor.7.26" n="26" />I think, then, that this is good for the present affliction―that it is good for a man to be as he is.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.27" osisID="1Cor.7.27" n="27" />Are you bound to a wife? Seek not a separation. Are you loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.28" osisID="1Cor.7.28" n="28" />But if you should marry, you would not sin. And if a virgin should marry, she would not sin. But such will have affliction in the flesh. But I spare you.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.7.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.29" osisID="1Cor.7.29" n="29" />Now, this I say, brethren, the time is fraught with trials. It remains that those who have wives be as though they had them not;
<verse eID="1Cor.7.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.30" osisID="1Cor.7.30" n="30" />and those who weep, as though they wept not; and those who rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those who buy, as though they possessed not:
<verse eID="1Cor.7.30" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.31" osisID="1Cor.7.31" n="31" />and those who use this world, as not abusing it; for the outward show of this world passes away.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.31" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.32" osisID="1Cor.7.32" n="32" />But I would have you to be without anxiety. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
<verse eID="1Cor.7.32" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.33" osisID="1Cor.7.33" n="33" />but he that is married, is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.33" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.34" osisID="1Cor.7.34" n="34" />There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in body and in spirit; but she that is married, is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.34" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.35" osisID="1Cor.7.35" n="35" />I speak this for your own profit; not that I would entangle you, but that you may decorously and devotedly wait upon the Lord, without distraction.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.7.35" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.36" osisID="1Cor.7.36" n="36" />But if any man thinks he would treat his virgin daughter amiss, should she pass the bloom of life, and it is necessary that it should be so, let him do as he pleases, he does not sin; let them (<transChange type="added">the suitor and the daughter</transChange>) marry.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.36" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.37" osisID="1Cor.7.37" n="37" />But he that stands firm in his purpose, having no necessity <transChange type="added">to give his daughter in marriage</transChange>, but has liberty with respect to his own will, and has thus decided in his own heart, that he will keep his daughter a virgin, does well.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.37" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.38" osisID="1Cor.7.38" n="38" />So then, even he that gives her in marriage, does well; but he that gives her not in marriage, does better.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.7.38" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.39" osisID="1Cor.7.39" n="39" />The wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her husband die, she is free to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.7.39" />
<verse sID="1Cor.7.40" osisID="1Cor.7.40" n="40" />But she is happier, in my judgment, if she remains as she is; and I think that I have, also, the Spirit of God.

<verse sID="1Cor.8.2" osisID="1Cor.8.2" n="2" />If any one thinks that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet, as he ought to know it:

<verse eID="1Cor.8.3" />

<verse eID="1Cor.8.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.5" osisID="1Cor.8.5" n="5" />For though there are those which are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are many gods, and many lords,)

<verse eID="1Cor.8.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.7" osisID="1Cor.8.7" n="7" />But all have not this knowledge; for some, under the persuasion that an idol is a reality, even yet eat meat, as if it were offered to an idol, and their conscience being weak, is defiled.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.8.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.8" osisID="1Cor.8.8" n="8" />But meat commends us not to God; for, neither if we eat are we better, nor, if we eat not, are we worse.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.9" osisID="1Cor.8.9" n="9" />But take heed, lest, by any means, this right of yours become a stumbling-block to those who are weak.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.10" osisID="1Cor.8.10" n="10" />For, if any one see you, who have knowledge, reclining at table in an idol’s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened, so that he will eat meats offered to idols?
<verse eID="1Cor.8.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.11" osisID="1Cor.8.11" n="11" />and will not the weak brother, for whom Christ died, perish through your knowledge?
<verse eID="1Cor.8.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.8.12" osisID="1Cor.8.12" n="12" />But if you sin in this way against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.8.12" />

<verse eID="1Cor.9.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.8" osisID="1Cor.9.8" n="8" />Do I speak these things as a man? Or does not the law, also, say the same?
<verse eID="1Cor.9.8" />

<verse sID="1Cor.9.11" osisID="1Cor.9.11" n="11" />If we have sown, for your benefit, things that are spiritual, is it a great thing that we reap your carnal things?

<verse sID="1Cor.9.15" osisID="1Cor.9.15" n="15" />But I have availed myself of none of these things; nor do I write these things that it should be so done to me. For it would be better for me to die, than that any one should make my boasting vain.
<verse eID="1Cor.9.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.9.16" osisID="1Cor.9.16" n="16" />For though I preach the gospel, I have no cause for boasting; for a necessity is laid upon me; yes, alas for me, if I preach not the gospel.

<verse eID="1Cor.10.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.10.28" osisID="1Cor.10.28" n="28" />But if any one say to you: This is sacrificed to idols; eat not, for the sake of him that pointed it out, and for conscience sake:

<verse sID="1Cor.10.29" osisID="1Cor.10.29" n="29" />conscience, I say, not your own, but that of the other. Why, then, is my liberty judged by the conscience of another?

<verse eID="1Cor.11.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.2" osisID="1Cor.11.2" n="2" />Now, I praise you, brethren, because you remember me in all things, and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.3" osisID="1Cor.11.3" n="3" />But I wish you to know, that the head of every man is the Christ, and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.4" osisID="1Cor.11.4" n="4" />Every man that prays or prophesies, having his head covered, dishonors his head.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.5" osisID="1Cor.11.5" n="5" />But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered, dishonors her head: for it is one and the same as if she was shaved.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.6" osisID="1Cor.11.6" n="6" />For if a woman has no vail on, let her also be shaved. But if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her have a vail.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.11.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.7" osisID="1Cor.11.7" n="7" />For a man ought not to vail his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.8" osisID="1Cor.11.8" n="8" />For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man:
<verse eID="1Cor.11.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.9" osisID="1Cor.11.9" n="9" />for the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.10" osisID="1Cor.11.10" n="10" />For this reason ought the woman to have a token of subjection on her head, on account of the angels.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.11" osisID="1Cor.11.11" n="11" />But neither is the woman without the man, nor the: man without the woman, in the Lord.

<verse sID="1Cor.11.14" osisID="1Cor.11.14" n="14" />Does not nature itself teach you, that, if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?

<verse sID="1Cor.11.18" osisID="1Cor.11.18" n="18" />For, in the first place, when you come together in the church, I hear that there are schisms among you, and I partly believe it:
<verse eID="1Cor.11.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.19" osisID="1Cor.11.19" n="19" />for there must be sects among you, that the approved may be made known among you.

<verse sID="1Cor.11.20" osisID="1Cor.11.20" n="20" />When, therefore, you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper;
<verse eID="1Cor.11.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.21" osisID="1Cor.11.21" n="21" />for each one, in eating, takes before another, his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.22" osisID="1Cor.11.22" n="22" />What, have you not houses in which to eat and drink? or do you despise the church of God, and put those to shame who have nothing to eat? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.11.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.23" osisID="1Cor.11.23" n="23" />For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: That the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was delivered up, took bread;
<verse eID="1Cor.11.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.24" osisID="1Cor.11.24" n="24" />and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said: Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of me.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.25" osisID="1Cor.11.25" n="25" />In like manner also, the cup, after he had supped, saying: This cup is the new covenant in my blood: do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.26" osisID="1Cor.11.26" n="26" />For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord’s death till he come.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.11.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.27" osisID="1Cor.11.27" n="27" />Wherefore he that eats this bread, or drinks this cup of the Lord, in an improper manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.28" osisID="1Cor.11.28" n="28" />But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup:
<verse eID="1Cor.11.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.29" osisID="1Cor.11.29" n="29" />for he that eats and drinks in an improper manner, eats and drinks condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.30" osisID="1Cor.11.30" n="30" />For this reason, many among you are weak and sick, and many sleep.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.30" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.31" osisID="1Cor.11.31" n="31" />For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged;
<verse eID="1Cor.11.31" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.32" osisID="1Cor.11.32" n="32" />but being judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
<verse eID="1Cor.11.32" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.33" osisID="1Cor.11.33" n="33" />Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one an other:-
<verse eID="1Cor.11.33" />
<verse sID="1Cor.11.34" osisID="1Cor.11.34" n="34" />and if any one is hungry, let him eat at home, that you come not together for condemnation. But other things I will set in order when I come.

<verse eID="1Cor.12.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.2" osisID="1Cor.12.2" n="2" />You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to those dumb idols, as you might be led.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.3" osisID="1Cor.12.3" n="3" />For this reason, I make known to you, that no one, speaking by the Spirit of God, calls Jesus accursed: and no one can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.

<verse eID="1Cor.12.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.7" osisID="1Cor.12.7" n="7" />But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one, for the good of all.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.8" osisID="1Cor.12.8" n="8" />For to one is given, by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit;

<verse eID="1Cor.12.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.11" osisID="1Cor.12.11" n="11" />But all these, the one and the same Spirit makes effectual, distributing to each, respectively, as he wills.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.12.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.12" osisID="1Cor.12.12" n="12" />For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.12.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.13" osisID="1Cor.12.13" n="13" />For by one Spirit we all were immersed into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and we all have been made to drink of one Spirit.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.12.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.14" osisID="1Cor.12.14" n="14" />For the body is not one member, but many.

<verse sID="1Cor.12.15" osisID="1Cor.12.15" n="15" />If the foot shall say: Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it, for this reason, no part of the body?

<verse eID="1Cor.12.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.23" osisID="1Cor.12.23" n="23" />And those members of the body, which, we think, are less honorable, around these we place the more abundant honor; and our uncomely members have the more abundant comeliness:
<verse eID="1Cor.12.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.24" osisID="1Cor.12.24" n="24" />for our comely members have no need. But God has so arranged the body, giving more abundant honor to that part which is deficient,
<verse eID="1Cor.12.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.12.25" osisID="1Cor.12.25" n="25" />that there may be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same anxious care, one for another;

<verse sID="1Cor.14.16" osisID="1Cor.14.16" n="16" />Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit that is given to you, how will he that occupies the place of the unlearned man say Amen, when you give thanks, since he understands not what you say?
<verse eID="1Cor.14.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.17" osisID="1Cor.14.17" n="17" />For you give thanks well, but the other is not edified.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.18" osisID="1Cor.14.18" n="18" />I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.19" osisID="1Cor.14.19" n="19" />Yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.14.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.20" osisID="1Cor.14.20" n="20" />Brethren, be not children in understanding: yet, in malice, be childlike; but, in understanding, be full-grown men.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.21" osisID="1Cor.14.21" n="21" />In the law it is written: Through men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.22" osisID="1Cor.14.22" n="22" />Therefore, tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to those who believe not: but prophecy is not for those who believe not, but for those who believe.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.14.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.23" osisID="1Cor.14.23" n="23" />If, then, the whole church come together into the same place, and all speak in tongues, and there come in unlearned men, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?
<verse eID="1Cor.14.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.24" osisID="1Cor.14.24" n="24" />But if all prophesy, and there comes in an unbeliever, or an unlearned man, he is convinced by all, he is examined by all,
<verse eID="1Cor.14.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.25" osisID="1Cor.14.25" n="25" />and the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is really among you.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.14.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.26" osisID="1Cor.14.26" n="26" />What, then, is it, brethren? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has something to teach, has an unknown tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.27" osisID="1Cor.14.27" n="27" />If any speak in an unknown tongue, let two, or, at most, three, speak at each meeting, and in succession: and let one interpret.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.28" osisID="1Cor.14.28" n="28" />But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church: but let him speak to himself, and to God.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.29" osisID="1Cor.14.29" n="29" />Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge:
<verse eID="1Cor.14.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.30" osisID="1Cor.14.30" n="30" />and if any thing be revealed to one who is sitting by, let the first be silent.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.30" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.31" osisID="1Cor.14.31" n="31" />For you can all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn, and all may be encouraged;
<verse eID="1Cor.14.31" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.32" osisID="1Cor.14.32" n="32" />and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;
<verse eID="1Cor.14.32" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.33" osisID="1Cor.14.33" n="33" />for God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.14.33" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.34" osisID="1Cor.14.34" n="34" />Let your women keep silence in the assemblies; for they ire not permitted to speak; but they must be in subjection, as also says the law.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.34" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.35" osisID="1Cor.14.35" n="35" />But if they wish to learn any thing,, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for women to speak in an assembly.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.35" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.36" osisID="1Cor.14.36" n="36" />Has the word of God come forth from you? or did it come to you only?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.14.36" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.37" osisID="1Cor.14.37" n="37" />If any one has the reputation of being a prophet, or spiritual man, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.37" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.38" osisID="1Cor.14.38" n="38" />But if any one be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.38" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.39" osisID="1Cor.14.39" n="39" />Wherefore, brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
<verse eID="1Cor.14.39" />
<verse sID="1Cor.14.40" osisID="1Cor.14.40" n="40" />Let all things be done with propriety, and in good order.

<chapter sID="1Cor.15" osisID="1Cor.15" n="15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.1" osisID="1Cor.15.1" n="1" />But I make known to you, brethren, the gospel that I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,
<verse eID="1Cor.15.1" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.2" osisID="1Cor.15.2" n="2" />by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.15.2" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.3" osisID="1Cor.15.3" n="3" />For I delivered to you among the first things, that which I also received: That Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures;
<verse eID="1Cor.15.3" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.4" osisID="1Cor.15.4" n="4" />and that he was buried; and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures;
<verse eID="1Cor.15.4" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.5" osisID="1Cor.15.5" n="5" />and that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve;
<verse eID="1Cor.15.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.6" osisID="1Cor.15.6" n="6" />after that, he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain till this day; but some have fallen asleep.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.6" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.7" osisID="1Cor.15.7" n="7" />After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.7" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.8" osisID="1Cor.15.8" n="8" />Last of all, he was seen by me also, as one untimely born.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.8" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.9" osisID="1Cor.15.9" n="9" />For I am the least of the apostles, and I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.9" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.10" osisID="1Cor.15.10" n="10" />But, by the grace of God, I am what I am; and his grace, which was bestowed on me, has not been bestowed in vain: but I have labored more abundantly than they all; not I, however, but the grace of God which was with me.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.10" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.11" osisID="1Cor.15.11" n="11" />Whether, therefore, I or they, so we preached, and so you believed.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.15.11" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.12" osisID="1Cor.15.12" n="12" />But if Christ is preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you, that a resurrection of the dead is impossible?
<verse eID="1Cor.15.12" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.13" osisID="1Cor.15.13" n="13" />But if a resurrection of the dead is impossible, Christ has not been raised.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.13" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.14" osisID="1Cor.15.14" n="14" />And if Christ has not been raised, then vain is our preaching, and vain also your faith.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.14" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.15" osisID="1Cor.15.15" n="15" />We are, indeed, also found false witnesses of God; for we have testified against God, that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise, if, indeed, the dead are not raised.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.15" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.16" osisID="1Cor.15.16" n="16" />For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised;
<verse eID="1Cor.15.16" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.17" osisID="1Cor.15.17" n="17" />and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.17" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.18" osisID="1Cor.15.18" n="18" />Then, also, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.18" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.19" osisID="1Cor.15.19" n="19" />If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most miserable.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.15.19" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.20" osisID="1Cor.15.20" n="20" />But now, Christ has risen from the dead, the first-fruits of those who slept.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.20" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.21" osisID="1Cor.15.21" n="21" />For, since through man came death, through man comes also the resurrection of the dead.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.21" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.22" osisID="1Cor.15.22" n="22" />For, as in Adam all die, so, also, in Christ shall all be made alive:
<verse eID="1Cor.15.22" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.23" osisID="1Cor.15.23" n="23" />but each in his own order; Christ the first-fruit, afterward, those who are Christ’s at his coming.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.23" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.24" osisID="1Cor.15.24" n="24" />Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down every principality and authority and power:
<verse eID="1Cor.15.24" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.25" osisID="1Cor.15.25" n="25" />for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.25" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.26" osisID="1Cor.15.26" n="26" />The last enemy, Death, shall be destroyed.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.26" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.27" osisID="1Cor.15.27" n="27" />For he has put all things under his feet. But when the scripture says, that all things are put under him, it is evident that he is excepted, who did put all things under him.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.27" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.28" osisID="1Cor.15.28" n="28" />And when all things shall have been put under him, then, also, shall the Son himself be subjected to him that did put all things under him, that God may be the all in all.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.15.28" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.29" osisID="1Cor.15.29" n="29" />For else, what shall those do, who are immersed for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why, then, are they immersed for the dead?
<verse eID="1Cor.15.29" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.30" osisID="1Cor.15.30" n="30" />And why are we in danger every hour?
<verse eID="1Cor.15.30" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.31" osisID="1Cor.15.31" n="31" />I protest, by the joy which I have over you in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.31" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.32" osisID="1Cor.15.32" n="32" />If, to speak as a man, I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.32" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.33" osisID="1Cor.15.33" n="33" />Be not deceived: Evil communications corrupt good manners.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.33" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.34" osisID="1Cor.15.34" n="34" />Awake, as you should, to soberness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.15.34" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.35" osisID="1Cor.15.35" n="35" />But some one will say: How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
<verse eID="1Cor.15.35" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.36" osisID="1Cor.15.36" n="36" />Thoughtless man! That which you sow is not made alive, unless it die;
<verse eID="1Cor.15.36" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.37" osisID="1Cor.15.37" n="37" />and as to that which you sow, you sow not the body that shall be produced, but the naked grain, it may be of wheat, or of some other grain:
<verse eID="1Cor.15.37" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.38" osisID="1Cor.15.38" n="38" />but God gives it a body, as it pleases him; and to every seed, its proper body.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.38" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.39" osisID="1Cor.15.39" n="39" />All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one flesh of men, another of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.39" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.40" osisID="1Cor.15.40" n="40" />There are also bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and that of the terrestrial is another.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.40" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.41" osisID="1Cor.15.41" n="41" />There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.15.41" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.42" osisID="1Cor.15.42" n="42" />So, also, is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption:
<verse eID="1Cor.15.42" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.43" osisID="1Cor.15.43" n="43" />it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power:
<verse eID="1Cor.15.43" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.44" osisID="1Cor.15.44" n="44" />it is sown an animal body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.44" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.45" osisID="1Cor.15.45" n="45" />So, also, it is written: The first man Adam became a living soul, the last Adam a life-giving spirit.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.45" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.46" osisID="1Cor.15.46" n="46" />But that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is animal; and afterward that which is spiritual.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.46" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.47" osisID="1Cor.15.47" n="47" />The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man, the Lord from heaven.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.47" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.48" osisID="1Cor.15.48" n="48" />As the earthy man was, such also are the earthy; and as the heavenly man is, such also shall the heavenly be.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.48" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.49" osisID="1Cor.15.49" n="49" />And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.49" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.50" osisID="1Cor.15.50" n="50" />But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Cor.15.50" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.51" osisID="1Cor.15.51" n="51" />Behold, I declare to you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed
<verse eID="1Cor.15.51" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.52" osisID="1Cor.15.52" n="52" />in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.52" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.53" osisID="1Cor.15.53" n="53" />For this corruptible body must put on incorruptibility; and this mortal body must put on immortality.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.53" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.54" osisID="1Cor.15.54" n="54" />And when this corruptible body shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal body shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.54" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.55" osisID="1Cor.15.55" n="55" />O Death, where is thy sting? O Hades, where is thy victory?
<verse eID="1Cor.15.55" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.56" osisID="1Cor.15.56" n="56" />The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.56" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.57" osisID="1Cor.15.57" n="57" />But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="1Cor.15.57" />
<verse sID="1Cor.15.58" osisID="1Cor.15.58" n="58" />Therefore, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; for you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

<verse eID="1Cor.16.5" />
<verse sID="1Cor.16.6" osisID="1Cor.16.6" n="6" />and perhaps I may abide with you, or even spend the winter, that you may conduct me on my way to whatever place I may go.

<verse sID="1Cor.16.7" osisID="1Cor.16.7" n="7" />FOE I do not wish to see you now in passing; for I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permit.
<verse eID="1Cor.16.7" />

<verse eID="1Cor.16.8" />

<p>
<verse sID="2Cor.1.1" osisID="2Cor.1.1" n="1" />Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy my brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:
<verse eID="2Cor.1.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.2" osisID="2Cor.1.2" n="2" />grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.1.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.3" osisID="2Cor.1.3" n="3" />Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort,
<verse eID="2Cor.1.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.4" osisID="2Cor.1.4" n="4" />who con soles us in all our afflictions, so that we are able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.5" osisID="2Cor.1.5" n="5" />For as the sufferings for the Christ abound in us, so also through Christ abounds our consolation.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.6" osisID="2Cor.1.6" n="6" />And if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which salvation is effected by your patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer; (and our hope in you is steadfast;) or if we are consoled, it is for your comfort and salvation;
<verse eID="2Cor.1.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.7" osisID="2Cor.1.7" n="7" />because we know, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you shall be partakers of the comfort.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.1.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.8" osisID="2Cor.1.8" n="8" />For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which came upon us in Asia, that we were exceedingly oppressed, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.9" osisID="2Cor.1.9" n="9" />But we have in ourselves the sentence of death, that we may not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead;
<verse eID="2Cor.1.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.10" osisID="2Cor.1.10" n="10" />who delivered us from so great a death, and does still deliver us: in whom we have confidence, that he will continue to deliver us,
<verse eID="2Cor.1.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.11" osisID="2Cor.1.11" n="11" />if you also unite in prayer for our aid, that the favor bestowed on us, through the intercession of many persons, may cause thanks to be given by many for us.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.1.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.12" osisID="2Cor.1.12" n="12" />For the ground of our rejoicing is this: the testimony of our conscience that we have lived in the world more―abundantly, indeed, for you―in sincerity and godly purity, not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.13" osisID="2Cor.1.13" n="13" />For we write to you nothing else than what you recognize, or even acknowledge; and which I hope you will acknowledge to the end;
<verse eID="2Cor.1.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.14" osisID="2Cor.1.14" n="14" />as some of you also acknowledge us, that we are the cause of your rejoicing, even as you, also, are of ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.1.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.15" osisID="2Cor.1.15" n="15" />And in this confidence I intended to go to you before, that you might have a second benefit;
<verse eID="2Cor.1.15" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.16" osisID="2Cor.1.16" n="16" />and by you, to pass through into Macedonia, and to come again to you from Macedonia, and be conducted by you into Judea.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.17" osisID="2Cor.1.17" n="17" />In forming this purpose, did I, therefore, behave with levity? or do I purpose what I purpose, according to the flesh, that there may be with me, yes yes, and no, no?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.1.17" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.18" osisID="2Cor.1.18" n="18" />But God is true; for our preaching to you was not yes and no:
<verse eID="2Cor.1.18" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.19" osisID="2Cor.1.19" n="19" />for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me and Sylvanus and Timothy, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.19" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.20" osisID="2Cor.1.20" n="20" />For whatever promises of God there are, are in him yes, and in him amen, to the glory of God by us.
<verse eID="2Cor.1.20" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.21" osisID="2Cor.1.21" n="21" />For he who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God,
<verse eID="2Cor.1.21" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.22" osisID="2Cor.1.22" n="22" />who has also set his seal upon us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.1.22" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.23" osisID="2Cor.1.23" n="23" />But I call on God as a witness against my soul, that wishing to spare you, I did not go to Corinth;
<verse eID="2Cor.1.23" />
<verse sID="2Cor.1.24" osisID="2Cor.1.24" n="24" />not that we are lords over your faith, but fellow-workers for your joy: for by faith you stand.

<chapter sID="2Cor.2" osisID="2Cor.2" n="2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.1" osisID="2Cor.2.1" n="1" />But I determined this in myself, that with sorrow I would not again come to you:
<verse eID="2Cor.2.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.2" osisID="2Cor.2.2" n="2" />for if I cause you to grieve, who is he that makes me glad, but he that is made sorry by me?
<verse eID="2Cor.2.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.3" osisID="2Cor.2.3" n="3" />And I wrote to you this very thing, that, on coming to you, I might not have sorrow from those from whom I ought to receive joy; because I have confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.4" osisID="2Cor.2.4" n="4" />For out of much affliction and distress of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you might be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly for you.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.2.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.5" osisID="2Cor.2.5" n="5" />But if any one has caused grief, he has grieved, not me only, but, in some measure―not to speak harshly―all of you.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.6" osisID="2Cor.2.6" n="6" />Sufficient for such a one is the punishment, which was inflicted by the greater number:
<verse eID="2Cor.2.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.7" osisID="2Cor.2.7" n="7" />so that, on the other hand, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest such a one should be swallowed up in too much sorrow.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.8" osisID="2Cor.2.8" n="8" />Wherefore, I exhort you to give him an assurance of your love.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.9" osisID="2Cor.2.9" n="9" />For I wrote to you for this purpose also, that I might have a sure proof from you, whether you are obedient in all things.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.10" osisID="2Cor.2.10" n="10" />Whom you forgive any thing, I forgive it also: for what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven any thing, I have forgiven for your sake, in the person of Christ,
<verse eID="2Cor.2.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.11" osisID="2Cor.2.11" n="11" />lest an advantage should be taken of us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his devices.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.2.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.12" osisID="2Cor.2.12" n="12" />And when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of the Christ, and a door was opened to me in the Lord,
<verse eID="2Cor.2.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.13" osisID="2Cor.2.13" n="13" />I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but I took leave of them, and went into Macedonia.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.2.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.14" osisID="2Cor.2.14" n="14" />Now, thanks be to God, who always causes us to triumph in the Christ, and sheds in every place, by us, the fragrance of the knowledge of himself.
<verse eID="2Cor.2.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.15" osisID="2Cor.2.15" n="15" />For, through God, we are a sweet odor of Christ, among the saved, and among the lost:
<verse eID="2Cor.2.15" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.16" osisID="2Cor.2.16" n="16" />to the one, we are the odor of death ending in death; to the other, the odor of life ending in life: and who is sufficient for these things?
<verse eID="2Cor.2.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.2.17" osisID="2Cor.2.17" n="17" />For we do not, as the many, adulterate the word of God; but, as from sincerity, but, as from God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.

<verse sID="2Cor.3.1" osisID="2Cor.3.1" n="1" />Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as some do, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?
<verse eID="2Cor.3.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.2" osisID="2Cor.3.2" n="2" />You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
<verse eID="2Cor.3.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.3" osisID="2Cor.3.3" n="3" />you are well known to be a letter of Christ, written by us as his ministers, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.3.3" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.4" osisID="2Cor.3.4" n="4" />Now, confidence such as this we have, through the Christ, toward God;
<verse eID="2Cor.3.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.5" osisID="2Cor.3.5" n="5" />not that we are able, of ourselves, to devise anything, as from ourselves; but our ability is from God,
<verse eID="2Cor.3.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.6" osisID="2Cor.3.6" n="6" />who has made us able ministers of the new covenant, not of letter, but of spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit makes alive.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.7" osisID="2Cor.3.7" n="7" />For if the ministering of death, <transChange type="added">by means of a covenant</transChange> that was written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the sons of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, which glory was to come to an end:
<verse eID="2Cor.3.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.8" osisID="2Cor.3.8" n="8" />how shall not the ministering of the spirit be more glorious?
<verse eID="2Cor.3.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.9" osisID="2Cor.3.9" n="9" />For if the ministering of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministering of righteousness surpass in glory.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.10" osisID="2Cor.3.10" n="10" />For that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that surpasses.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.11" osisID="2Cor.3.11" n="11" />For if that which was to come to an end was glorious, much more that which is to remain is glorious.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.3.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.12" osisID="2Cor.3.12" n="12" />Since then we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech,
<verse eID="2Cor.3.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.13" osisID="2Cor.3.13" n="13" />and do not as Moses did, who put a vail over his face, so that the sons of Israel could not steadily look to the end of that which was to come to an end.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.14" osisID="2Cor.3.14" n="14" />But their minds were blinded: for till this day, in the reading of the old covenant, the same vail remains not taken away, which vail is removed in Christ.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.15" osisID="2Cor.3.15" n="15" />But to this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart:
<verse eID="2Cor.3.15" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.16" osisID="2Cor.3.16" n="16" />but whenever their heart shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.16" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.17" osisID="2Cor.3.17" n="17" />Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
<verse eID="2Cor.3.17" />
<verse sID="2Cor.3.18" osisID="2Cor.3.18" n="18" />And we all, with unvailed face, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit.

<verse eID="2Cor.4.1" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.2" osisID="2Cor.4.2" n="2" />but we have renounced the secret works of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God; but, by the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.4.2" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.3" osisID="2Cor.4.3" n="3" />But if our gospel is vailed, it is vailed among the lost,

<verse sID="2Cor.4.4" osisID="2Cor.4.4" n="4" />whose unbelieving minds the god of this age has darkened, so that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine to them.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.4" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.5" osisID="2Cor.4.5" n="5" />For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants, for Jesus sake.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.6" osisID="2Cor.4.6" n="6" />Because God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the person of Jesus Christ.

<verse sID="2Cor.4.7" osisID="2Cor.4.7" n="7" />But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be God’s and not our own.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.8" osisID="2Cor.4.8" n="8" />We are pressed on all sides, yet not restrained; perplexed, but not in despair;

<verse sID="2Cor.4.9" osisID="2Cor.4.9" n="9" />persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
<verse eID="2Cor.4.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.10" osisID="2Cor.4.10" n="10" />always bearing about in our body the violent death of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our body.
<verse eID="2Cor.4.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.11" osisID="2Cor.4.11" n="11" />For we who live are continually delivered up to death for Jesus sake, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.4.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.4.12" osisID="2Cor.4.12" n="12" />So, then, death is active in us, but life in you.

<verse sID="2Cor.4.13" osisID="2Cor.4.13" n="13" />But, having the same spirit of faith, according to that winch is written, I believed, and for this reason I have spoken; we also believe, and for this reason we speak,

<verse sID="2Cor.4.15" osisID="2Cor.4.15" n="15" />For all these afflictions are for your sakes, that the favor which abounds <transChange type="added">to me</transChange>, may, through the thanksgiving of the many, abound richly to the glory of God.

<verse eID="2Cor.5.5" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.6" osisID="2Cor.5.6" n="6" />Therefore, we are always confident, especially since we know that, while living in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
<verse eID="2Cor.5.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.7" osisID="2Cor.5.7" n="7" />for we walk by faith, not by sight:
<verse eID="2Cor.5.7" />

<verse sID="2Cor.5.9" osisID="2Cor.5.9" n="9" />For this reason we also endeavor, whether we remain in the body or depart from it, to be acceptable to him.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.10" osisID="2Cor.5.10" n="10" />For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each may receive his reward for the things done in his body, according to what he has done, whether good or evil.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.5.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.11" osisID="2Cor.5.11" n="11" />Knowing, then, the fearful judgment of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God. I hope, indeed, that we are also made manifest in your consciences.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.12" osisID="2Cor.5.12" n="12" />We do not again commend ourselves to you, but give you an occasion to boast of us, that you may be able to answer those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.12" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.13" osisID="2Cor.5.13" n="13" />For if we be beside ourselves, it is for God; or, if we be of sound mind, it is for you.
<verse eID="2Cor.5.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.14" osisID="2Cor.5.14" n="14" />For the love of Christ constrains us, because we have this judgment―that if one died for all, then have all died:
<verse eID="2Cor.5.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.5.15" osisID="2Cor.5.15" n="15" />and he died for all, that those who live should no more live for themselves, but for him who died for them, and rose again.

<verse sID="2Cor.8.2" osisID="2Cor.8.2" n="2" />that under an afflicting trial, their overflowing joy, and their deep poverty, abounded to the riches of their liberality;

</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.8.6" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.7" osisID="2Cor.8.7" n="7" />Now as you excel in every thing, in faith, and in speech, and in knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love for us, see that you excel in this gift also.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.8" osisID="2Cor.8.8" n="8" />I do not speak this as a commandment, but on account of the zeal of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.8" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.9" osisID="2Cor.8.9" n="9" />For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet, for your sakes, he became poor, that you, through his poverty, might become rich.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.9" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.10" osisID="2Cor.8.10" n="10" />And I give my judgment in this matter; for this is profitable for you, who began not only to do, but to show a willing mind, a year ago.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.10" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.11" osisID="2Cor.8.11" n="11" />Now, therefore, perfect also the doing of this; that as there was a readiness of mind to be willing, so also there may be an accomplishment <transChange type="added">of the doing</transChange>, out of that which you have.
<verse eID="2Cor.8.11" />
<verse sID="2Cor.8.12" osisID="2Cor.8.12" n="12" />For if there is a readiness of mind, one is accepted according to what he has, not according to what he has not.

<verse sID="2Cor.9.2" osisID="2Cor.9.2" n="2" />For I know your readiness of mind, on account of which I boasted of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago: and your zeal has incited very many.

<verse sID="2Cor.11.4" osisID="2Cor.11.4" n="4" />For if he that comes should preach another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or, if you receive another Spirit, which you did not receive, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you would well bear with him.

<verse sID="2Cor.11.9" osisID="2Cor.11.9" n="9" />for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied my wants; and in every thing I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and will continue to keep myself.

<verse eID="2Cor.11.13" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.14" osisID="2Cor.11.14" n="14" />and no wonder, for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.

<verse eID="2Cor.11.28" />
<verse sID="2Cor.11.29" osisID="2Cor.11.29" n="29" />Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I am not incensed?

</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Cor.12.6" />

<verse eID="2Cor.12.7" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.8" osisID="2Cor.12.8" n="8" />With regard to this, I three times entreated the Lord that it might leave me;

<verse sID="2Cor.12.9" osisID="2Cor.12.9" n="9" />and he said to me: My grace is sufficient for you; for my power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Christ may abide upon me.

<verse eID="2Cor.12.14" />
<verse sID="2Cor.12.15" osisID="2Cor.12.15" n="15" />I, indeed, will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

<verse eID="Gal.1.6" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.7" osisID="Gal.1.7" n="7" />which is nothing else than that there are some who trouble you, and are determined to pervert the gospel of the Christ.
<verse eID="Gal.1.7" />
<verse sID="Gal.1.8" osisID="Gal.1.8" n="8" />But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach to you any other gospel than that which we have preached, let him be accursed.

<verse sID="Gal.2.10" osisID="Gal.2.10" n="10" /><transChange type="added">requesting</transChange> only that we would remember the poor, which same thing I have been diligent in doing.

<p>
<verse eID="Gal.2.10" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.11" osisID="Gal.2.11" n="11" />But when Peter came to Antioch, I openly opposed him, because he had incurred blame.
<verse eID="Gal.2.11" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.12" osisID="Gal.2.12" n="12" />For, before certain persons came from James, he ate with the Gentiles: but, when they had come, he withdrew, and separated himself, because he feared those who were of the circumcision.
<verse eID="Gal.2.12" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.13" osisID="Gal.2.13" n="13" />And the other Jews, also, acted hypocritically with him, so that even Barnabas was led away by their hypocrisy.

<p>
<verse eID="Gal.2.13" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.14" osisID="Gal.2.14" n="14" />But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter, before them all: If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of the Gentiles, and not after the manner of the Jews, why do you compel the Gen tiles to observe Jewish customs?
<verse eID="Gal.2.14" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.15" osisID="Gal.2.15" n="15" />We, who are Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners,
<verse eID="Gal.2.15" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.16" osisID="Gal.2.16" n="16" />knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed on Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ, and not by works of law: because, by works of law no flesh shall be justified.
<verse eID="Gal.2.16" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.17" osisID="Gal.2.17" n="17" />But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are also found sinners, is Christ, therefore, the minister of sin? It can not be.
<verse eID="Gal.2.17" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.18" osisID="Gal.2.18" n="18" />For if I build again those things which I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
<verse eID="Gal.2.18" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.19" osisID="Gal.2.19" n="19" />For, through law, I have died to law, that I might live to God.
<verse eID="Gal.2.19" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.20" osisID="Gal.2.20" n="20" />I have been crucified with Christ, yet I live; no longer I, but Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
<verse eID="Gal.2.20" />
<verse sID="Gal.2.21" osisID="Gal.2.21" n="21" />I do not set aside the grace of God: for if righteousness be through law, then Christ has died in vain.

<chapter sID="Gal.3" osisID="Gal.3" n="3" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.1" osisID="Gal.3.1" n="1" />O thoughtless Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been plainly set forth crucified?
<verse eID="Gal.3.1" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.2" osisID="Gal.3.2" n="2" />This only I wish to learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of law, or by the hearing of faith?
<verse eID="Gal.3.2" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.3" osisID="Gal.3.3" n="3" />Are you so thoughtless? After having begun in Spirit, do you make an end in flesh?
<verse eID="Gal.3.3" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.4" osisID="Gal.3.4" n="4" />Have you suffered so many things in vain? if, indeed, it be in vain.
<verse eID="Gal.3.4" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.5" osisID="Gal.3.5" n="5" />He that supplies to you the Spirit, and works mighty deeds among you, does he this by works of law or by the hearing of faith?
<verse eID="Gal.3.5" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.6" osisID="Gal.3.6" n="6" />even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Gal.3.6" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.7" osisID="Gal.3.7" n="7" />Know, therefore, that those who are of faith are the sons of Abraham.
<verse eID="Gal.3.7" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.8" osisID="Gal.3.8" n="8" />For the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached beforehand the gospel to Abraham, saying: In you shall all the nations be blessed.
<verse eID="Gal.3.8" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.9" osisID="Gal.3.9" n="9" />So, then, those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Gal.3.9" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.10" osisID="Gal.3.10" n="10" />For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that does not continue in all things written in the book of the law to do them.
<verse eID="Gal.3.10" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.11" osisID="Gal.3.11" n="11" />But that no one is justified by law in the sight of God, is evident: for the just by faith shall live.
<verse eID="Gal.3.11" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.12" osisID="Gal.3.12" n="12" />The law, indeed, is not of faith; but he that does these things shall live by them.
<verse eID="Gal.3.12" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.13" osisID="Gal.3.13" n="13" />Christ has bought us off from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us: (for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:)
<verse eID="Gal.3.13" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.14" osisID="Gal.3.14" n="14" />in order that the blessing of Abraham may come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we may receive the promise of the Spirit through the faith.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Gal.3.14" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.15" osisID="Gal.3.15" n="15" />Brethren, I speak of things common among men: No one sets a covenant aside, or enjoins any thing additional after it is confirmed, though it be a man’s covenant.
<verse eID="Gal.3.15" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.16" osisID="Gal.3.16" n="16" />Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring; he does not say: And to offsprings, <transChange type="added">as if he spoke</transChange> of many; but as of one, And to your offspring, which is Christ.
<verse eID="Gal.3.16" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.17" osisID="Gal.3.17" n="17" />And this I affirm, that the covenant which had been before confirmed by God with respect to Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, could not annul so as to make the promise of no effect.
<verse eID="Gal.3.17" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.18" osisID="Gal.3.18" n="18" />For if the inheritance be by law, it is no longer by promise: but God bestowed it on Abraham by promise.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Gal.3.18" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.19" osisID="Gal.3.19" n="19" />What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added on account of transgressions, (till the offspring should come, to whom the promise was made,) having been appointed through the service of angels, in the hand of a mediator.
<verse eID="Gal.3.19" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.20" osisID="Gal.3.20" n="20" />Now, a mediator for one is impossible; but God is one.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Gal.3.20" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.21" osisID="Gal.3.21" n="21" />Is the law, then, against the promises of God? It can not be. For if a law had been given which could have given life, surely righteousness would have been by law.
<verse eID="Gal.3.21" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.22" osisID="Gal.3.22" n="22" />But the scripture has shut up all under sin, that the promise by faith in Christ Jesus may be given to those who believe.
<verse eID="Gal.3.22" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.23" osisID="Gal.3.23" n="23" />But before the faith came, we were kept under law, being shut up to the faith which was to be revealed.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Gal.3.23" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.24" osisID="Gal.3.24" n="24" />So, then, the law was our pedagogue that <transChange type="added">led us</transChange> to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
<verse eID="Gal.3.24" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.25" osisID="Gal.3.25" n="25" />But since the faith has come, we are no longer under a pedagogue:
<verse eID="Gal.3.25" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.26" osisID="Gal.3.26" n="26" />for you are all the sons of God, by faith in Christ Jesus:
<verse eID="Gal.3.26" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.27" osisID="Gal.3.27" n="27" />for as many of you as have been immersed into Christ, have put on Christ.
<verse eID="Gal.3.27" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.28" osisID="Gal.3.28" n="28" />There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bondman nor freeman, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Gal.3.28" />
<verse sID="Gal.3.29" osisID="Gal.3.29" n="29" />And if you are Christ s, then you are Abraham’s posterity, and heirs according to the promise.

<verse eID="Gal.4.1" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.2" osisID="Gal.4.2" n="2" />but is under guardians and managers till the time appointed by the father.
<verse eID="Gal.4.2" />

<verse eID="Gal.4.3" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.4" osisID="Gal.4.4" n="4" />But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,

<verse sID="Gal.4.5" osisID="Gal.4.5" n="5" />that he might buy off those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption.

<verse eID="Gal.4.12" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.13" osisID="Gal.4.13" n="13" />You know that through weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first:

<verse sID="Gal.4.14" osisID="Gal.4.14" n="14" />and my trial, which was in my flesh, you did not despise or loathe; but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
<verse eID="Gal.4.14" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.15" osisID="Gal.4.15" n="15" />How great, then, was your blessedness! For I testify for you, that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes, and have given them to me.

<verse eID="Gal.4.21" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.22" osisID="Gal.4.22" n="22" />For it is written, that Abraham had two sons; one by a bondmaid, and one by a free woman.

<verse sID="Gal.4.23" osisID="Gal.4.23" n="23" />But the one by the bondmaid was born according to the flesh; the other, by the free woman, was by promise.
<verse eID="Gal.4.23" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.24" osisID="Gal.4.24" n="24" />These things are allegorized: for these women are the two covenants; the one from the Mount Sinai that brings forth for bondage, which is Hagar.
<verse eID="Gal.4.24" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.25" osisID="Gal.4.25" n="25" />For Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in bondage with her children.
<verse eID="Gal.4.25" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.26" osisID="Gal.4.26" n="26" />But Jerusalem which is above is free; and she is the mother of us all.
<verse eID="Gal.4.26" />
<verse sID="Gal.4.27" osisID="Gal.4.27" n="27" />For it is written: Rejoice you barren, that do not bear: break forth and cry aloud, you that travail not: for many more are the children of the deserted, than of her that had the husband of the <transChange type="added">deserted</transChange>.
<verse eID="Gal.4.27" />

<verse eID="Gal.6.11" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.12" osisID="Gal.6.12" n="12" />As many as wish to make a fair show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of the Christ.
<verse eID="Gal.6.12" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.13" osisID="Gal.6.13" n="13" />For not even do those very men, who are circumcised, keep the law: but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.
<verse eID="Gal.6.13" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.14" osisID="Gal.6.14" n="14" />But may I never boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
<verse eID="Gal.6.14" />
<verse sID="Gal.6.15" osisID="Gal.6.15" n="15" />For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision is any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
<verse eID="Gal.6.15" />

<verse eID="Eph.5.3" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.4" osisID="Eph.5.4" n="4" />nor obscene language, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not becoming; but rather the cheerful words of a thankful heart.
<verse eID="Eph.5.4" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.5" osisID="Eph.5.5" n="5" />For you know this, that no lewd nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and of God.
<verse eID="Eph.5.5" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.6" osisID="Eph.5.6" n="6" />Let no one deceive you with vain words: for on account of these things, the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
<verse eID="Eph.5.6" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.7" osisID="Eph.5.7" n="7" />Therefore, be not partakers with them.
<verse eID="Eph.5.7" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.8" osisID="Eph.5.8" n="8" />For you were formerly darkness; but now you are light in the Lord: walk as children of light;
<verse eID="Eph.5.8" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.9" osisID="Eph.5.9" n="9" />(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
<verse eID="Eph.5.9" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.10" osisID="Eph.5.10" n="10" />learning what is acceptable to the Lord;
<verse eID="Eph.5.10" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.11" osisID="Eph.5.11" n="11" />and do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;
<verse eID="Eph.5.11" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.12" osisID="Eph.5.12" n="12" />for it is a shame even to speak of the things that are done by them in secret.
<verse eID="Eph.5.12" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.13" osisID="Eph.5.13" n="13" />But all these works, when reproved, are made manifest by the light: for every thing that makes manifest is light.
<verse eID="Eph.5.13" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.14" osisID="Eph.5.14" n="14" />Wherefore, the scripture says: Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Eph.5.14" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.15" osisID="Eph.5.15" n="15" />See, then, that you walk circumspectly, not as unwise, but as wise men,
<verse eID="Eph.5.15" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.16" osisID="Eph.5.16" n="16" />redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
<verse eID="Eph.5.16" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.17" osisID="Eph.5.17" n="17" />Wherefore, be not ignorant, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
<verse eID="Eph.5.17" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.18" osisID="Eph.5.18" n="18" />And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit;
<verse eID="Eph.5.18" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.19" osisID="Eph.5.19" n="19" />speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,
<verse eID="Eph.5.19" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.20" osisID="Eph.5.20" n="20" />giving thanks to our God and Father always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
<verse eID="Eph.5.20" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.21" osisID="Eph.5.21" n="21" />being subject one to another in the fear of God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Eph.5.21" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.22" osisID="Eph.5.22" n="22" />Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord:
<verse eID="Eph.5.22" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.23" osisID="Eph.5.23" n="23" />for the husband is the head of the wife, as the Christ also is the head of the church; and he is the savior of the body.
<verse eID="Eph.5.23" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.24" osisID="Eph.5.24" n="24" />But as the church is subject to the Christ, so, also, let the wives be subject to their own husbands in every thing.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Eph.5.24" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.25" osisID="Eph.5.25" n="25" />Husbands, love your wives, as the Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it,
<verse eID="Eph.5.25" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.26" osisID="Eph.5.26" n="26" />that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the bath of water through the word,
<verse eID="Eph.5.26" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.27" osisID="Eph.5.27" n="27" />in order that he might present it to himself a glorious church, having neither stain, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
<verse eID="Eph.5.27" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.28" osisID="Eph.5.28" n="28" />So ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself;
<verse eID="Eph.5.28" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.29" osisID="Eph.5.29" n="29" />for no one ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Christ the church:
<verse eID="Eph.5.29" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.30" osisID="Eph.5.30" n="30" />because we are members of his body, being of his flesh, and of his bones.
<verse eID="Eph.5.30" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.31" osisID="Eph.5.31" n="31" />For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.
<verse eID="Eph.5.31" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.32" osisID="Eph.5.32" n="32" />Great is this mystery; but I speak of Christ and of the church.
<verse eID="Eph.5.32" />
<verse sID="Eph.5.33" osisID="Eph.5.33" n="33" />But yet, let each one of you so love his wife as himself; and let the wife see that she reverence her husband.

<verse sID="Eph.6.8" osisID="Eph.6.8" n="8" />knowing that whatever good any one does, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he is a servant or a freeman.

<verse sID="Eph.6.9" osisID="Eph.6.9" n="9" />And you masters, do the same things to them, leaving off threatening, knowing that you yourselves have a master in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.

<verse eID="Eph.6.11" />

<verse eID="Eph.6.12" />
<verse sID="Eph.6.13" osisID="Eph.6.13" n="13" />Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand <transChange type="added">them</transChange> in the evil day, and having overcome them all, to stand firm.

<verse eID="Phil.1.6" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.7" osisID="Phil.1.7" n="7" />as it is right for me to think this of you all, because <transChange type="added">I say I have</transChange> you in my heart; both in my bonds and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, I say I have you all in my heart as being joint partakers of my grace.

<verse eID="Phil.1.13" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.14" osisID="Phil.1.14" n="14" />and most of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence in my bonds, are more bold to speak the word without fear.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Phil.1.14" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.15" osisID="Phil.1.15" n="15" />Some, indeed, preach the Christ, because of envy and a contentious disposition, and some because of good-will.
<verse eID="Phil.1.15" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.16" osisID="Phil.1.16" n="16" />These do it from love, because they know that I am set for the defense of the gospel;

<verse sID="Phil.1.17" osisID="Phil.1.17" n="17" />those preach Christ from a contentious disposition, not sincerely, thinking that they will add affliction to my bonds.
<verse eID="Phil.1.17" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.18" osisID="Phil.1.18" n="18" />What difference does this make? Christ is, nevertheless, preached in every way, whether in pretense or in truth; and in this I rejoice, yes, and I will rejoice:
<verse eID="Phil.1.18" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.19" osisID="Phil.1.19" n="19" />for I know that this will result in my benefit through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Phil.1.20" />
<verse sID="Phil.1.21" osisID="Phil.1.21" n="21" />For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

<verse eID="1Thess.2.1" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.2" osisID="1Thess.2.2" n="2" />But having suffered before, and having been outraged, as you know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in the midst of great peril.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.2" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.3" osisID="1Thess.2.3" n="3" />For our exhortation arose not from deception, nor from uncleanness, nor was it with guile;
<verse eID="1Thess.2.3" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.4" osisID="1Thess.2.4" n="4" />but as God had judged us worthy to be intrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tries our hearts.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.4" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.5" osisID="1Thess.2.5" n="5" />For neither nattering words did we at any time use, as you know, nor a pretext for covetousness; God is witness:
<verse eID="1Thess.2.5" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.6" osisID="1Thess.2.6" n="6" />nor did we seek glory from men, neither from you nor from others; though we could have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.6" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.7" osisID="1Thess.2.7" n="7" />But we were gentle among you. As a nurse nourishes her children,

<verse sID="1Thess.2.8" osisID="1Thess.2.8" n="8" />so, having a strong affection for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but our own lives also, because you had become dear to us.

<verse eID="1Thess.2.9" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.10" osisID="1Thess.2.10" n="10" />You are witnesses, and God also, in how holy and just and blameless a manner we conducted ourselves among you that believe,
<verse eID="1Thess.2.10" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.11" osisID="1Thess.2.11" n="11" />as indeed you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father his children,
<verse eID="1Thess.2.11" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.12" osisID="1Thess.2.12" n="12" />that you should walk in a manner worthy of God, who has called you to his own kingdom and glory.

<verse eID="1Thess.2.12" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.13" osisID="1Thess.2.13" n="13" />For this reason, also, we thank God without ceasing; because, when you received the word of God, as preached by us, you embraced it, not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works in you that believe.
<verse eID="1Thess.2.13" />
<verse sID="1Thess.2.14" osisID="1Thess.2.14" n="14" />For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea which are in Christ Jesus; for you, also, have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, that they have suffered from the Jews,

<verse sID="1Thess.2.15" osisID="1Thess.2.15" n="15" />who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and do not please God, and are opposed to all men,

<verse sID="1Thess.4.6" osisID="1Thess.4.6" n="6" />That no one take advantage of or injure his brother in this matter; because the Lord takes vengeance for all such things, as we also told you before, and fully testified:
<verse eID="1Thess.4.6" />
<verse sID="1Thess.4.7" osisID="1Thess.4.7" n="7" />for God has not called us for uncleanness, but for holiness.

<verse sID="1Thess.5.1" osisID="1Thess.5.1" n="1" />But, brethren, you have no need that I write to you of the times and seasons;
<verse eID="1Thess.5.1" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.2" osisID="1Thess.5.2" n="2" />for you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night:
<verse eID="1Thess.5.2" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.3" osisID="1Thess.5.3" n="3" />for when they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as the pains of birth upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Thess.5.3" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.4" osisID="1Thess.5.4" n="4" />But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.4" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.5" osisID="1Thess.5.5" n="5" />You are all sons of light, and sons of day: we are not of night, nor of darkness.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.5" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.6" osisID="1Thess.5.6" n="6" />Therefore, let us not sleep, as do others, but let us watch and be sober.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.6" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.7" osisID="1Thess.5.7" n="7" />For those who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunken, are drunken in the night.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.7" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.8" osisID="1Thess.5.8" n="8" />But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation:
<verse eID="1Thess.5.8" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.9" osisID="1Thess.5.9" n="9" />for God has not appointed us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
<verse eID="1Thess.5.9" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.10" osisID="1Thess.5.10" n="10" />who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we might live together with him.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.10" />

<verse sID="1Thess.5.12" osisID="1Thess.5.12" n="12" />Now we beseech you, brethren, to have regard for those who labor among you, and preside over you in the Lord, and admonish you,
<verse eID="1Thess.5.12" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.13" osisID="1Thess.5.13" n="13" />and that you esteem them very highly in love on account of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
<verse eID="1Thess.5.13" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.14" osisID="1Thess.5.14" n="14" />We exhort you, brethren, admonish the unruly, comfort the faint-hearted, earnestly care for the weak-minded, be of a long-suffering disposition toward all.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="1Thess.5.14" />
<verse sID="1Thess.5.15" osisID="1Thess.5.15" n="15" />See that no one render evil for evil to any, but always pursue that which is good toward one another and toward all.

<verse eID="Titus.3.8" />
<verse sID="Titus.3.9" osisID="Titus.3.9" n="9" />But foolish questions and genealogies and strifes and contentions about the law, avoid; for they are unprofitable and vain.

<verse sID="Heb.1.1" osisID="Heb.1.1" n="1" />God, who in many parts and in many ways spoke in ancient times to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by his Son,
<verse eID="Heb.1.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.1.2" osisID="Heb.1.2" n="2" />whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom, also, he made the ages;

<verse sID="Heb.1.3" osisID="Heb.1.3" n="3" />who, being the effulgence of his glory and the exact representation of his essence, and upholding all things by his own powerful word, when he had by himself made expiation for our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
<verse eID="Heb.1.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.1.4" osisID="Heb.1.4" n="4" />having become so far superior to the angels, as the name which he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.1.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.1.5" osisID="Heb.1.5" n="5" />For to which of the angels did he at any time say: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again: I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
<verse eID="Heb.1.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.1.6" osisID="Heb.1.6" n="6" />And again, when he brings the first-begotten into the world, he says: And let all the angels of God worship him.
<verse eID="Heb.1.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.1.7" osisID="Heb.1.7" n="7" />And of the angels he says: Who makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire.

<verse sID="Heb.1.8" osisID="Heb.1.8" n="8" />But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is from age to age: a scepter of rectitude is the scepter of thy kingdom.
<verse eID="Heb.1.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.1.9" osisID="Heb.1.9" n="9" />Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore, God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
<verse eID="Heb.1.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.1.10" osisID="Heb.1.10" n="10" />And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning, didst lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thy hands.

<verse eID="Heb.2.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.2" osisID="Heb.2.2" n="2" />For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment,
<verse eID="Heb.2.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.3" osisID="Heb.2.3" n="3" />how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? which at first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard him;

<verse eID="Heb.2.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.6" osisID="Heb.2.6" n="6" />But one in a certain place testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him; or the son of man, that thou dost visit him?
<verse eID="Heb.2.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.7" osisID="Heb.2.7" n="7" />Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honor;

<verse sID="Heb.2.9" osisID="Heb.2.9" n="9" />But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, that he might, by the grace of God, taste death for every man―we see him, on account of his having suffered death, crowned with glory and honor.
<verse eID="Heb.2.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.10" osisID="Heb.2.10" n="10" />For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.2.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.11" osisID="Heb.2.11" n="11" />For both he that sanctifies, and those who are sanctified, are all of one Father: for which reason, he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:
<verse eID="Heb.2.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.12" osisID="Heb.2.12" n="12" />I will declare thy name among my brethren; in the midst of the assembly, will I sing hymns to thee.

<verse sID="Heb.2.13" osisID="Heb.2.13" n="13" />And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold, I, and the children that God has given me.
<verse eID="Heb.2.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.14" osisID="Heb.2.14" n="14" />Since, then, the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also, in like manner, partook of the same, that, through his death, he might deprive of power him that has the power of death, that is, the devil;
<verse eID="Heb.2.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.15" osisID="Heb.2.15" n="15" />and might set free those who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
<verse eID="Heb.2.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.16" osisID="Heb.2.16" n="16" />For, verily, he does not take hold of angels, but he takes hold of the posterity of Abraham.
<verse eID="Heb.2.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.2.17" osisID="Heb.2.17" n="17" />Wherefore, it behooved him to be made like his brethren in all things, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, in order to make expiation for the sins of the people.
<verse eID="Heb.2.17" />

<verse eID="Heb.3.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.2" osisID="Heb.3.2" n="2" />who is faithful to him that appointed him, as Moses also was faithful in all his house.

<verse eID="Heb.3.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.8" osisID="Heb.3.8" n="8" />harden not your hearts, as in the bitter provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness,

<verse eID="Heb.3.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.11" osisID="Heb.3.11" n="11" />so that I swore in my anger, They shall not enter into my rest.
<verse eID="Heb.3.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.12" osisID="Heb.3.12" n="12" />Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in apostatizing from the living God.
<verse eID="Heb.3.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.13" osisID="Heb.3.13" n="13" />But exhort one another daily, while it is called To-day, lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
<verse eID="Heb.3.13" />

<verse eID="Heb.3.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.16" osisID="Heb.3.16" n="16" />For some, when they had heard, did bitterly provoke; yet, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
<verse eID="Heb.3.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.3.17" osisID="Heb.3.17" n="17" />But with whom was he angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?

<verse sID="Heb.4.2" osisID="Heb.4.2" n="2" />For we have had the good news preached to us, even as they had: but the word preached did not profit them, for it was not mixed with faith in those who heard it.

<verse eID="Heb.4.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.4.12" osisID="Heb.4.12" n="12" />For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and pierces even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

<chapter sID="Heb.5" osisID="Heb.5" n="5" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.1" osisID="Heb.5.1" n="1" />For every high priest chosen from among men, is appointed for men, in things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins:
<verse eID="Heb.5.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.2" osisID="Heb.5.2" n="2" />being able to have compassion on the ignorant and erring, because he himself is beset with infirmity:
<verse eID="Heb.5.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.3" osisID="Heb.5.3" n="3" />and on account of this, he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to make offering for sins.
<verse eID="Heb.5.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.4" osisID="Heb.5.4" n="4" />And no one takes this honor to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron also was called.
<verse eID="Heb.5.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.5" osisID="Heb.5.5" n="5" />So, also, the Christ did not take upon himself the honor of becoming a high priest: but he <transChange type="added">gave him this honor</transChange>, who said to him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee:
<verse eID="Heb.5.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.6" osisID="Heb.5.6" n="6" />as he says also in another place, Thou art a priest forever, after the order of Melchisedec.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.5.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.7" osisID="Heb.5.7" n="7" />In the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, to him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard with respect to that which he feared,
<verse eID="Heb.5.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.8" osisID="Heb.5.8" n="8" />although he was a Son, he yet learned obedience from the things which he suffered;
<verse eID="Heb.5.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.9" osisID="Heb.5.9" n="9" />and, having been made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all that obey him,
<verse eID="Heb.5.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.10" osisID="Heb.5.10" n="10" />being called by God a high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.5.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.11" osisID="Heb.5.11" n="11" />Of him we have many things to say, and difficult to be explained, if we do say them, since you are slow in understanding.
<verse eID="Heb.5.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.12" osisID="Heb.5.12" n="12" />For though you ought to be teachers, considering the time, yet you have need that some one teach you again what are the first elements of the oracles of God; and you have become such as have need of milk, and not of strong food.
<verse eID="Heb.5.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.13" osisID="Heb.5.13" n="13" />For every one that partakes of milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
<verse eID="Heb.5.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.5.14" osisID="Heb.5.14" n="14" />But strong food belongs to those who are of mature age, who, by use, have their internal senses exercised to the discerning of both good and evil.
<verse eID="Heb.5.14" />

<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.6" osisID="Heb.6" n="6" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.1" osisID="Heb.6.1" n="1" />Therefore, omitting the elementary Christian teaching, let us go on to the perfection <transChange type="added">of Christian instruction</transChange>, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
<verse eID="Heb.6.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.2" osisID="Heb.6.2" n="2" />of the teaching with respect to immersions, and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal condemnation.
<verse eID="Heb.6.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.3" osisID="Heb.6.3" n="3" />And this we will do, if God permit.
<verse eID="Heb.6.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.4" osisID="Heb.6.4" n="4" />For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,
<verse eID="Heb.6.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.5" osisID="Heb.6.5" n="5" />and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the coming age,
<verse eID="Heb.6.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.6" osisID="Heb.6.6" n="6" />if they fall away; since they again crucify in themselves the Son of God, and put him to an open shame.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.6.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.7" osisID="Heb.6.7" n="7" />For the land which drinks up the rain that comes often upon it, and produces herbs suitable for those for whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God.
<verse eID="Heb.6.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.8" osisID="Heb.6.8" n="8" />But that which produces thorns and thistles is rejected, and is near the curse, the end of which is to be burned.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.6.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.9" osisID="Heb.6.9" n="9" />But, beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, and of things that tend to salvation, though we thus speak.
<verse eID="Heb.6.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.10" osisID="Heb.6.10" n="10" />For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love which you have shown for his name by having ministered to the saints, and by continuing to minister.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.6.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.11" osisID="Heb.6.11" n="11" />But we desire every one of you to show the same diligence, in order to have your hope fully assured to the end:
<verse eID="Heb.6.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.12" osisID="Heb.6.12" n="12" />that you may not become slothful, but imitators of those who, through faith and patience, inherit the promises.
<verse eID="Heb.6.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.13" osisID="Heb.6.13" n="13" />For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,
<verse eID="Heb.6.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.14" osisID="Heb.6.14" n="14" />saying: Most surely will I abundantly bless you, and abundantly multiply you.
<verse eID="Heb.6.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.15" osisID="Heb.6.15" n="15" />And so, when he had waited patiently, he received the promises.
<verse eID="Heb.6.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.16" osisID="Heb.6.16" n="16" />For, verily, men swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all contradiction.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.6.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.17" osisID="Heb.6.17" n="17" />Wherefore, God, being more abundantly willing to show to the heirs of his promise the immutability of his purpose, interposed an oath,
<verse eID="Heb.6.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.18" osisID="Heb.6.18" n="18" />that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled to lay hold on the hope set before us;
<verse eID="Heb.6.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.19" osisID="Heb.6.19" n="19" />which, hope we have as an anchor for the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters in beyond the vail,
<verse eID="Heb.6.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.6.20" osisID="Heb.6.20" n="20" />whither a forerunner for us has gone, even Jesus, who is made a high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.
<verse eID="Heb.6.20" />
<chapter eID="Heb.6" />

<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.7" osisID="Heb.7" n="7" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.1" osisID="Heb.7.1" n="1" />For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,
<verse eID="Heb.7.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.2" osisID="Heb.7.2" n="2" />to whom also Abraham gave a tenth of all, being, first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then, also, King of Salem, which means King of peace,
<verse eID="Heb.7.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.3" osisID="Heb.7.3" n="3" />without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but being made to resemble the Son of God, remains a priest forever.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.7.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.4" osisID="Heb.7.4" n="4" />Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils.
<verse eID="Heb.7.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.5" osisID="Heb.7.5" n="5" />And those of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
<verse eID="Heb.7.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.6" osisID="Heb.7.6" n="6" />but he who does not count his genealogy from them, received tithes from Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
<verse eID="Heb.7.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.7" osisID="Heb.7.7" n="7" />And, without any contradiction, the less is blessed by the better.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.7.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.8" osisID="Heb.7.8" n="8" />And in the one instance, men that die receive tithes; but in the other, he receives them who has the testimony that he lives.
<verse eID="Heb.7.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.9" osisID="Heb.7.9" n="9" />And so to speak, even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham;
<verse eID="Heb.7.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.10" osisID="Heb.7.10" n="10" />for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.7.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.11" osisID="Heb.7.11" n="11" />If, then, there had been a perfect expiation by means of the Levitical priesthood, (for with reference to it, the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should be raised up after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
<verse eID="Heb.7.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.12" osisID="Heb.7.12" n="12" />It is evident that, when the priest hood is changed, there is of necessity a change also of the law.
<verse eID="Heb.7.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.13" osisID="Heb.7.13" n="13" />For he of whom these things are said, belongs to another tribe, from which no one attended upon the altar.
<verse eID="Heb.7.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.14" osisID="Heb.7.14" n="14" />For it is very clear that our Lord sprung from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.7.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.15" osisID="Heb.7.15" n="15" />And it is yet far more evident, if, after the likeness of Melchisedec, there arises another priest,
<verse eID="Heb.7.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.16" osisID="Heb.7.16" n="16" />who is made, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life; for he testifies,
<verse eID="Heb.7.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.17" osisID="Heb.7.17" n="17" />Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.7.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.18" osisID="Heb.7.18" n="18" />For, indeed, there is a setting aside of the preceding commandment, because it was weak and unprofitable,
<verse eID="Heb.7.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.19" osisID="Heb.7.19" n="19" />(for the law made no perfect expiation), and the introduction of a better hope, by which we draw near to God.
<verse eID="Heb.7.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.20" osisID="Heb.7.20" n="20" />And inasmuch as he was made a priest, not without an oath,
<verse eID="Heb.7.20" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.21" osisID="Heb.7.21" n="21" />(for those priests were made such without an oath, but this one with an oath, by him that said to him, The Lord swore, and will not repent, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec;)
<verse eID="Heb.7.21" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.22" osisID="Heb.7.22" n="22" />in so much has Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.7.22" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.23" osisID="Heb.7.23" n="23" />And those priests, indeed, have been many, because they were prevented by death from continuing <transChange type="added">in office</transChange>.
<verse eID="Heb.7.23" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.24" osisID="Heb.7.24" n="24" />But this man, because he continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.
<verse eID="Heb.7.24" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.25" osisID="Heb.7.25" n="25" />Wherefore, he is able also to save through all time those who come to God by him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.7.25" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.26" osisID="Heb.7.26" n="26" />For such a high priest is suited to us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and exalted above the heavens;
<verse eID="Heb.7.26" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.27" osisID="Heb.7.27" n="27" />who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
<verse eID="Heb.7.27" />
<verse sID="Heb.7.28" osisID="Heb.7.28" n="28" />For the law makes men high priests, who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, makes the Son, who is perfected forever.
<verse eID="Heb.7.28" />
<chapter eID="Heb.7" />
</p>
<!-- cl --><milestone type="x-chapterLabel" n="VIII." />
<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.8" osisID="Heb.8" n="8" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.1" osisID="Heb.8.1" n="1" />Now concerning the things that have been spoken, the principal point is <transChange type="added">this</transChange>: We have such a high priest, who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
<verse eID="Heb.8.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.2" osisID="Heb.8.2" n="2" />a minister of the holy places, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.8.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.3" osisID="Heb.8.3" n="3" />For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore, it is necessary that this one also have something which he may offer.
<verse eID="Heb.8.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.4" osisID="Heb.8.4" n="4" />For if he were on earth, he could not be a priest; because there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
<verse eID="Heb.8.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.5" osisID="Heb.8.5" n="5" />and these serve the copy and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: See now, says he, that you make all things according to the pattern shown you in the mount.
<verse eID="Heb.8.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.6" osisID="Heb.8.6" n="6" />But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is the mediator of a better covenant, which is established with reference to better promises.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.8.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.7" osisID="Heb.8.7" n="7" />For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.
<verse eID="Heb.8.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.8" osisID="Heb.8.8" n="8" />For, finding fault with them, he says: Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will ratify a new covenant for the house of Israel, and for the house of Judah:
<verse eID="Heb.8.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.9" osisID="Heb.8.9" n="9" />not like the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
<verse eID="Heb.8.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.10" osisID="Heb.8.10" n="10" />For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, says the Lord; putting my laws into their understanding, I will also write them upon their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;
<verse eID="Heb.8.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.11" osisID="Heb.8.11" n="11" />and they shall not teach, every one his citizen, and every one his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest;
<verse eID="Heb.8.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.12" osisID="Heb.8.12" n="12" />because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.8.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.8.13" osisID="Heb.8.13" n="13" />In saying, A new covenant, he has regarded the first as out of use. Now, that which is out of use, and has become old, is ready to disappear.
<verse eID="Heb.8.13" />
<chapter eID="Heb.8" />

<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.9" osisID="Heb.9" n="9" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.1" osisID="Heb.9.1" n="1" />Now, the first covenant also had ordinances of worship, and the worldly sanctuary:
<verse eID="Heb.9.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.2" osisID="Heb.9.2" n="2" />for a tabernacle was constructed, the first, in which were the candlestick, and the table, and the presence bread; and this tabernacle is called holy.
<verse eID="Heb.9.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.3" osisID="Heb.9.3" n="3" />But after the second vail, the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies;
<verse eID="Heb.9.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.4" osisID="Heb.9.4" n="4" />which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that held the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
<verse eID="Heb.9.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.5" osisID="Heb.9.5" n="5" />and over the ark, the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we can not now speak particularly.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.9.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.6" osisID="Heb.9.6" n="6" />Now, when these things were thus arranged, the priests went, at all times, into the first tabernacle, discharging the service of God.
<verse eID="Heb.9.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.7" osisID="Heb.9.7" n="7" />But into the second, the high priest alone went, once during the year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:
<verse eID="Heb.9.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.8" osisID="Heb.9.8" n="8" />the Holy Spirit signifying this, that the way into the most holy was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle was still standing,
<verse eID="Heb.9.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.9" osisID="Heb.9.9" n="9" />which, as a symbol, <transChange type="added">remains</transChange> to the present time, in which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that can not make perfect, as it respects the conscience, him that does the service;
<verse eID="Heb.9.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.10" osisID="Heb.9.10" n="10" /><transChange type="added">since he relies</transChange> only on meats and drinks and various immersions, ordinances indeed of the flesh, which were imposed till the time of reformation.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.9.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.11" osisID="Heb.9.11" n="11" />But Christ, having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, (that is, not of this building,)
<verse eID="Heb.9.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.12" osisID="Heb.9.12" n="12" />entered, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, once for all, into the most holy, having obtained eternal redemption.
<verse eID="Heb.9.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.13" osisID="Heb.9.13" n="13" />For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, cleanses them as it respects the purity of the flesh,
<verse eID="Heb.9.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.14" osisID="Heb.9.14" n="14" />how much more will the blood of the Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works, in order that you may serve the living God?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.9.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.15" osisID="Heb.9.15" n="15" />And for this reason, he is the mediator of the new covenant: that, since his death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions that were under the former covenant, those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
<verse eID="Heb.9.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.16" osisID="Heb.9.16" n="16" />For where a testament is, it is necessary that there be brought in the death of the testator:
<verse eID="Heb.9.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.17" osisID="Heb.9.17" n="17" />for a testament goes into effect after men are dead: seeing that it has no validity at all while the testator lives.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.9.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.18" osisID="Heb.9.18" n="18" />Wherefore, the first covenant was not instituted without blood.
<verse eID="Heb.9.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.19" osisID="Heb.9.19" n="19" />For when Moses had spoken to all the people every commandment of the law, lie took the blood of calves and of goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying:
<verse eID="Heb.9.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.20" osisID="Heb.9.20" n="20" />This is the blood of the covenant which God enjoins on you:
<verse eID="Heb.9.20" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.21" osisID="Heb.9.21" n="21" />and, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the service.
<verse eID="Heb.9.21" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.22" osisID="Heb.9.22" n="22" />And, indeed, according to the law, almost all things are cleansed by blood; and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.9.22" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.23" osisID="Heb.9.23" n="23" />It was necessary, therefore, that the copies of the things in the heavens should be consecrated by these sacrifices; but that the heavenly things themselves should be consecrated by better sacrifices than these.
<verse eID="Heb.9.23" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.24" osisID="Heb.9.24" n="24" />For the Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, the copies of the true; but he has entered heaven itself, now to present himself in the presence of God for us.
<verse eID="Heb.9.24" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.25" osisID="Heb.9.25" n="25" />Nor <transChange type="added">has he entered</transChange>, that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with the blood of another:
<verse eID="Heb.9.25" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.26" osisID="Heb.9.26" n="26" />for then, he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once in the end of the ages, he has appeared in order to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
<verse eID="Heb.9.26" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.27" osisID="Heb.9.27" n="27" />And, as it is appointed to men once to die, and after this the judgment,
<verse eID="Heb.9.27" />
<verse sID="Heb.9.28" osisID="Heb.9.28" n="28" />so the Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to those who look for him he will appear the second time, without a sin-offering, in order to salvation.

<chapter sID="Heb.10" osisID="Heb.10" n="10" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.1" osisID="Heb.10.1" n="1" />For the law, having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never, with the same sacrifices, which they offer year by year continually, make a perfect expiation for those who come to them:
<verse eID="Heb.10.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.2" osisID="Heb.10.2" n="2" />for then, would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshipers, after being once cleansed, would no longer have a consciousness of sins.
<verse eID="Heb.10.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.3" osisID="Heb.10.3" n="3" />There is, however, in these sacrifices, a remembrance of sins every year.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.10.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.4" osisID="Heb.10.4" n="4" />For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
<verse eID="Heb.10.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.5" osisID="Heb.10.5" n="5" />Wherefore, when he comes into the world, he says: Sacrifice and offering thou hast not desired, but a body thou hast prepared me;
<verse eID="Heb.10.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.6" osisID="Heb.10.6" n="6" />in whole burnt-offerings and offerings for sin, thou hast had no pleasure.
<verse eID="Heb.10.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.7" osisID="Heb.10.7" n="7" />Then, said I, Behold, I come, (in the roll of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
<verse eID="Heb.10.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.8" osisID="Heb.10.8" n="8" />After saying above, Thou didst neither desire, nor take pleasure in sacrifice and offering and whole burnt-offerings and offerings for sin, which are offered according to the law,
<verse eID="Heb.10.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.9" osisID="Heb.10.9" n="9" />then he said, Behold, I come to do thy will: he takes away the first, that he may establish the second.
<verse eID="Heb.10.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.10" osisID="Heb.10.10" n="10" />By which will, we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.10.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.11" osisID="Heb.10.11" n="11" />And every priest stands daily ministering, and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
<verse eID="Heb.10.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.12" osisID="Heb.10.12" n="12" />but after offering one sacrifice for sins, he himself sits continually at the right hand of God,
<verse eID="Heb.10.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.13" osisID="Heb.10.13" n="13" />henceforth waiting till his enemies be made his footstool.
<verse eID="Heb.10.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.14" osisID="Heb.10.14" n="14" />For by one offering, he has made a perfect and perpetual expiation for the sanctified.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.10.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.15" osisID="Heb.10.15" n="15" />And, indeed, the Holy Spirit is a witness for us. For after he had said before,
<verse eID="Heb.10.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.16" osisID="Heb.10.16" n="16" />This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; putting my laws in their hearts, I will also write them in their understandings:
<verse eID="Heb.10.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.17" osisID="Heb.10.17" n="17" />he adds, And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.
<verse eID="Heb.10.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.18" osisID="Heb.10.18" n="18" />Now, where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.10.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.19" osisID="Heb.10.19" n="19" />Having therefore, brethren, confidence to enter the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
<verse eID="Heb.10.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.20" osisID="Heb.10.20" n="20" />by a new and living way which he has dedicated for us, through the vail, that is, his flesh;
<verse eID="Heb.10.20" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.21" osisID="Heb.10.21" n="21" />and having a great high, priest over the house of God,
<verse eID="Heb.10.21" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.22" osisID="Heb.10.22" n="22" />let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having; our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water;
<verse eID="Heb.10.22" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.23" osisID="Heb.10.23" n="23" />let us hold fast the unwavering confession of our hope, for he is faithful who has promised;
<verse eID="Heb.10.23" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.24" osisID="Heb.10.24" n="24" />and let us consider one another that we may excite to love and good works,
<verse eID="Heb.10.24" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.25" osisID="Heb.10.25" n="25" />not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the custom of some; but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.10.25" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.26" osisID="Heb.10.26" n="26" />For if we sin willfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no longer a sacrifice for sins;
<verse eID="Heb.10.26" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.27" osisID="Heb.10.27" n="27" />but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and a fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries.
<verse eID="Heb.10.27" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.28" osisID="Heb.10.28" n="28" />He that despised Moses law, died without mercy, on the testimony of two or three witnesses:
<verse eID="Heb.10.28" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.29" osisID="Heb.10.29" n="29" />of how much severer punishment do you think he shall be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, a common thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?
<verse eID="Heb.10.29" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.30" osisID="Heb.10.30" n="30" />For we know him who has said, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge his people.
<verse eID="Heb.10.30" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.31" osisID="Heb.10.31" n="31" />It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.10.31" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.32" osisID="Heb.10.32" n="32" />But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings;
<verse eID="Heb.10.32" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.33" osisID="Heb.10.33" n="33" />partly, while you became a public spectacle, by reproaches and afflictions: partly, while you became partakers with those who were so treated.
<verse eID="Heb.10.33" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.34" osisID="Heb.10.34" n="34" />For you sympathized with me in my bonds, and endured joyfully the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and abiding substance in the heavens.
<verse eID="Heb.10.34" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.35" osisID="Heb.10.35" n="35" />Cast not away, therefore, your confidence, which has a great reward.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.10.35" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.36" osisID="Heb.10.36" n="36" />For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise.
<verse eID="Heb.10.36" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.37" osisID="Heb.10.37" n="37" />For yet a very, very little while, and He that comes will come, and will not delay.
<verse eID="Heb.10.37" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.38" osisID="Heb.10.38" n="38" />But the just by faith shall live; and if he draw back, my soul will have no pleasure in him.
<verse eID="Heb.10.38" />
<verse sID="Heb.10.39" osisID="Heb.10.39" n="39" />But we are not of those who draw back to perdition; but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.

<chapter sID="Heb.11" osisID="Heb.11" n="11" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.1" osisID="Heb.11.1" n="1" />Now, faith is a sure confidence with respect to things hoped for, a firm persuasion with respect to things not seen:
<verse eID="Heb.11.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.2" osisID="Heb.11.2" n="2" />for by this the ancients obtained a good reputation.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.3" osisID="Heb.11.3" n="3" />By faith we understand that the ages were set in order by the word of God, so that the things which are seen, have not come into being from things that appear.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.4" osisID="Heb.11.4" n="4" />By faith Abel offered to God more sacrifice than Cain; on account of which he received testimony that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and by it he, though dead, yet speaks.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.5" osisID="Heb.11.5" n="5" />By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had the testimony that he pleased God.
<verse eID="Heb.11.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.6" osisID="Heb.11.6" n="6" />But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.7" osisID="Heb.11.7" n="7" />By faith Noah, after being warned concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house; by which faith he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.8" osisID="Heb.11.8" n="8" />By faith Abraham, when called to go out into a place that he should afterward receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
<verse eID="Heb.11.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.9" osisID="Heb.11.9" n="9" />By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
<verse eID="Heb.11.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.10" osisID="Heb.11.10" n="10" />for he looked for a city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
<verse eID="Heb.11.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.11" osisID="Heb.11.11" n="11" />By faith also Sarah herself received strength for the conception of seed, and brought forth a child when past the time of life, because she counted him faithful who had promised.
<verse eID="Heb.11.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.12" osisID="Heb.11.12" n="12" />Therefore, there were born of one, who was dead as it respects these things, a posterity like the stars of heaven in multitude, and like the sand on the sea-shore, innumerable.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.13" osisID="Heb.11.13" n="13" />All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and having embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners in the land.
<verse eID="Heb.11.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.14" osisID="Heb.11.14" n="14" />For those who say such things, declare plainly that they seek a country.
<verse eID="Heb.11.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.15" osisID="Heb.11.15" n="15" />And if indeed they had been mindful of that from which they came, they could have had an opportunity to return.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.16" osisID="Heb.11.16" n="16" />But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly country; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, that he should be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.17" osisID="Heb.11.17" n="17" />By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: even his first-born, did he that had received the promises, offer up,
<verse eID="Heb.11.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.18" osisID="Heb.11.18" n="18" />of which first-born it was said: In Isaac shall your posterity be called:
<verse eID="Heb.11.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.19" osisID="Heb.11.19" n="19" />for he concluded that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; wherefore he received him even in like manner.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.20" osisID="Heb.11.20" n="20" />By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
<verse eID="Heb.11.20" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.21" osisID="Heb.11.21" n="21" />By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped on the top of his staff.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.21" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.22" osisID="Heb.11.22" n="22" />By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the departure of the sons of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.22" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.23" osisID="Heb.11.23" n="23" />By faith Moses was concealed by his parents for three months after his birth, because they saw that he was a beautiful child: and they feared not the command of the king.
<verse eID="Heb.11.23" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.24" osisID="Heb.11.24" n="24" />By faith Moses, when he became a man, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,
<verse eID="Heb.11.24" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.25" osisID="Heb.11.25" n="25" />choosing rather to suffer evil with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season;
<verse eID="Heb.11.25" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.26" osisID="Heb.11.26" n="26" />esteeming the reproach on account of the Christ as greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he earnestly looked to the reward.
<verse eID="Heb.11.26" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.27" osisID="Heb.11.27" n="27" />By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king: for he patiently endured, as seeing him that is invisible.
<verse eID="Heb.11.27" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.28" osisID="Heb.11.28" n="28" />By faith he kept the passover, and the affusion of blood, that he who destroyed the first-born might not touch them.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.28" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.29" osisID="Heb.11.29" n="29" />By faith they passed through the Bed Sea as by dry land, which the Egyptians attempting to do, were drowned.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.29" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.30" osisID="Heb.11.30" n="30" />By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after the people had gone around them for seven days.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.30" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.31" osisID="Heb.11.31" n="31" />By faith Rabab the harlot perished not with the disobedient, because she had received the spies with peace.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.31" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.32" osisID="Heb.11.32" n="32" />And what further shall I say? For the time would fail me, were I to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah, of David also and Samuel, and of the prophets,
<verse eID="Heb.11.32" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.33" osisID="Heb.11.33" n="33" />who, through faith, subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, closed the mouths of lions,
<verse eID="Heb.11.33" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.34" osisID="Heb.11.34" n="34" />quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
<verse eID="Heb.11.34" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.35" osisID="Heb.11.35" n="35" />Women received their dead raised to life again: but others were beat to death, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection;
<verse eID="Heb.11.35" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.36" osisID="Heb.11.36" n="36" />others had trial of mockings and scourgings, bonds also, and imprisonments.
<verse eID="Heb.11.36" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.37" osisID="Heb.11.37" n="37" />They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheep-skins, in goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, oppressed with evils,
<verse eID="Heb.11.37" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.38" osisID="Heb.11.38" n="38" />(of whom the world was not worthy,) wandering in deserts, and in mountains, and in caverns, and in dens of the earth.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.11.38" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.39" osisID="Heb.11.39" n="39" />And all these, having obtained a good reputation by faith, received not the promise,
<verse eID="Heb.11.39" />
<verse sID="Heb.11.40" osisID="Heb.11.40" n="40" />because God had provided some better thing for us, that they, without us, should not be made perfect.
<verse eID="Heb.11.40" />

<!-- cl --><milestone type="x-chapterLabel" n="XII." />
<p>
<chapter sID="Heb.12" osisID="Heb.12" n="12" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.1" osisID="Heb.12.1" n="1" />Wherefore, since we also have so great a cloud of witnesses lying round about us, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin that so easily besets us, and let us run with patience the race that lies before us,
<verse eID="Heb.12.1" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.2" osisID="Heb.12.2" n="2" />looking to Jesus the author and finisher of the faith, who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.
<verse eID="Heb.12.2" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.3" osisID="Heb.12.3" n="3" />For consider him that endured such opposition of sinners against himself, lest you become weary and despondent in your minds.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.12.3" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.4" osisID="Heb.12.4" n="4" />You have not yet resisted to blood, in your contest with sin;
<verse eID="Heb.12.4" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.5" osisID="Heb.12.5" n="5" />and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as to sons: My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him.
<verse eID="Heb.12.5" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.6" osisID="Heb.12.6" n="6" />For, whom the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every son that he receives.
<verse eID="Heb.12.6" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.7" osisID="Heb.12.7" n="7" />If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons: for what son is there whose father chastens him not?
<verse eID="Heb.12.7" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.8" osisID="Heb.12.8" n="8" />But if you are without chastisement, of which all are par takers, then are you bastards, and not sons.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.12.8" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.9" osisID="Heb.12.9" n="9" />So, then, we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and we reverenced them; shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of our spirits, and live?
<verse eID="Heb.12.9" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.10" osisID="Heb.12.10" n="10" />For they, indeed, for a few days, chastened us as they thought it good; but he chastens us for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.
<verse eID="Heb.12.10" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.11" osisID="Heb.12.11" n="11" />But no chastisement seems, at the time, to be a matter of joy, but of grief: yet afterward, it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who are exercised by it.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.12.11" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.12" osisID="Heb.12.12" n="12" />Wherefore, lift up the hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees,
<verse eID="Heb.12.12" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.13" osisID="Heb.12.13" n="13" />and make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned aside; but rather let it be restored to health.
<verse eID="Heb.12.13" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.14" osisID="Heb.12.14" n="14" />Follow peace with all, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord;
<verse eID="Heb.12.14" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.15" osisID="Heb.12.15" n="15" />taking care, lest any one slight the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness spring up and trouble you, and by this many be defiled;
<verse eID="Heb.12.15" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.16" osisID="Heb.12.16" n="16" />lest there be any lewd person, or profane man, as Esau, who, for a single meal, sold his birthright.
<verse eID="Heb.12.16" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.17" osisID="Heb.12.17" n="17" />For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no means to change <transChange type="added">his father’s</transChange> mind, though he sought it earnestly with tears.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Heb.12.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.18" osisID="Heb.12.18" n="18" />For you have not come to a mountain that may be touched, and that burns with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest,
<verse eID="Heb.12.18" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.19" osisID="Heb.12.19" n="19" />and to the sound of a trumpet, and to the utterance of words, the hearing of which utterance caused the people to entreat that the word might not be spoken to them again;
<verse eID="Heb.12.19" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.20" osisID="Heb.12.20" n="20" />for they could not endure that which was commanded, And if even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned:
<verse eID="Heb.12.20" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.21" osisID="Heb.12.21" n="21" />and so terrible was the sight, that even Moses said, I exceedingly fear and tremble.
<verse eID="Heb.12.21" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.22" osisID="Heb.12.22" n="22" />But you have come to Mount Zion, and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels;
<verse eID="Heb.12.22" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.23" osisID="Heb.12.23" n="23" />to the general assembly and church of the first-born, who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect,
<verse eID="Heb.12.23" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.24" osisID="Heb.12.24" n="24" />and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than the blood of Abel.

<verse eID="Heb.12.25" />
<verse sID="Heb.12.26" osisID="Heb.12.26" n="26" />whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I will shake not the earth only, but also the heaven.

<verse eID="Heb.13.17" />
<verse sID="Heb.13.18" osisID="Heb.13.18" n="18" />Pray for us: for we trust that we have a good conscience, willing to live honorably in all things.

<verse eID="Jas.1.1" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.2" osisID="Jas.1.2" n="2" />My brethren, count it all joy, when you fall into manifold trials,
<verse eID="Jas.1.2" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.3" osisID="Jas.1.3" n="3" />knowing that the trial of your faith produces patience.
<verse eID="Jas.1.3" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.4" osisID="Jas.1.4" n="4" />But let patience have its work perfected, that you may be perfect and faultless, wanting in nothing.

<verse sID="Jas.1.5" osisID="Jas.1.5" n="5" />Now, if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally, and upbraids not; and it shall be given him.
<verse eID="Jas.1.5" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.6" osisID="Jas.1.6" n="6" />But let him ask in faith, doubting not: for he that doubts, is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind, and tossed.
<verse eID="Jas.1.6" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.7" osisID="Jas.1.7" n="7" />For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord.
<verse eID="Jas.1.7" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.8" osisID="Jas.1.8" n="8" />A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Jas.1.8" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.9" osisID="Jas.1.9" n="9" />Let the brother that is in a lowly condition, glory in his exaltation:

<verse eID="Jas.1.10" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.11" osisID="Jas.1.11" n="11" />For the sun rises with its burning heat, and withers the grass, and its flower falls, and the beauty of its form perishes. So, also, shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Jas.1.11" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.12" osisID="Jas.1.12" n="12" />Blessed is the man that endures trial: for, being approved, he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love him.
<verse eID="Jas.1.12" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.13" osisID="Jas.1.13" n="13" />Let no one say, when he is tempted, My temptation is from God; for God can not be tempted by evils, and he himself tempts no man.
<verse eID="Jas.1.13" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.14" osisID="Jas.1.14" n="14" />But every one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desire, and is deluded.
<verse eID="Jas.1.14" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.15" osisID="Jas.1.15" n="15" />So, then, desire, when it has conceived, brings forth sin; and sin, when it is matured, brings forth death.

<p>
<verse eID="Jas.1.15" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.16" osisID="Jas.1.16" n="16" />Be not deceived, my beloved brethren;

<verse sID="Jas.1.17" osisID="Jas.1.17" n="17" />every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor slightest trace of turning.
<verse eID="Jas.1.17" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.18" osisID="Jas.1.18" n="18" />Of his own will, he begot us with the word of truth, in order that we might be, as it were, the first-fruits of his creatures.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Jas.1.18" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.19" osisID="Jas.1.19" n="19" />So, then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.
<verse eID="Jas.1.19" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.20" osisID="Jas.1.20" n="20" />For the wrath of man produces not the righteousness of God.
<verse eID="Jas.1.20" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.21" osisID="Jas.1.21" n="21" />Wherefore, laying aside all filthiness, and every excess caused by malice, receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Jas.1.21" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.22" osisID="Jas.1.22" n="22" />But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
<verse eID="Jas.1.22" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.23" osisID="Jas.1.23" n="23" />For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man that looks at his natural face in a mirror:
<verse eID="Jas.1.23" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.24" osisID="Jas.1.24" n="24" />for he looks at himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what sort of person he is.
<verse eID="Jas.1.24" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.25" osisID="Jas.1.25" n="25" />But he that looks intently into the perfect law of liberty, and remains constant, being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, he shall be blessed in his deed.

<p>
<verse eID="Jas.1.25" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.26" osisID="Jas.1.26" n="26" />If any one among you seems to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.
<verse eID="Jas.1.26" />
<verse sID="Jas.1.27" osisID="Jas.1.27" n="27" />Religion, pure and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

<verse sID="Jas.2.1" osisID="Jas.2.1" n="1" />My brethren, do not hold the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, so as to show a partiality for persons.
<verse eID="Jas.2.1" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.2" osisID="Jas.2.2" n="2" />For if there comes into your assembly a man in splendid apparel, and with gold rings on his fingers, and there comes in also a poor man, in mean clothing,
<verse eID="Jas.2.2" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.3" osisID="Jas.2.3" n="3" />and you show regard to him that wears the splendid apparel, and say to him, Sit here, in an honorable place; and you say to the poor man, Do you stand there, or sit here, under my footstool;
<verse eID="Jas.2.3" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.4" osisID="Jas.2.4" n="4" />are you not partial in yourselves? and do you not judge from false principles?
<verse eID="Jas.2.4" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.5" osisID="Jas.2.5" n="5" />Hear, my beloved brethren: Has not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God has promised to those who love him?
<verse eID="Jas.2.5" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.6" osisID="Jas.2.6" n="6" />But you dishonor the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and do they not themselves drag you to the judgment-seats?
<verse eID="Jas.2.6" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.7" osisID="Jas.2.7" n="7" />Do they not themselves revile that honorable name which is called upon you?
<verse eID="Jas.2.7" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.8" osisID="Jas.2.8" n="8" />If, however, you fulfill the law of highest excellence, according to the scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well.
<verse eID="Jas.2.8" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.9" osisID="Jas.2.9" n="9" />But if you show partiality for persons, you work sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Jas.2.9" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.10" osisID="Jas.2.10" n="10" />For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet fail in one, is an offender against all.
<verse eID="Jas.2.10" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.11" osisID="Jas.2.11" n="11" />For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now, though you do not commit adultery, yet, if you kill, you are a transgresssor of law.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Jas.2.11" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.12" osisID="Jas.2.12" n="12" />So speak, and so act, as those who shall be judged by the law of liberty.
<verse eID="Jas.2.12" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.13" osisID="Jas.2.13" n="13" />For he shall have judgment without mercy, who has shown no mercy. Mercy glories over judgment.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Jas.2.13" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.14" osisID="Jas.2.14" n="14" />What profit is there, my brethren, if any one say he has faith, and have not works? Can faith save him?
<verse eID="Jas.2.14" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.15" osisID="Jas.2.15" n="15" />If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
<verse eID="Jas.2.15" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.16" osisID="Jas.2.16" n="16" />and any of you say to them, Go in peace, be warmed and be filled, and yet give them not the things that are needful for the body, what does this profit them?
<verse eID="Jas.2.16" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.17" osisID="Jas.2.17" n="17" />So, also, faith, if it has not works, is dead, being by itself.
<verse eID="Jas.2.17" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.18" osisID="Jas.2.18" n="18" />But some one will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith by your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
<verse eID="Jas.2.18" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.19" osisID="Jas.2.19" n="19" />You believe that there is one God; you do well: the demons also believe, and tremble.
<verse eID="Jas.2.19" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.20" osisID="Jas.2.20" n="20" />But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Jas.2.20" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.21" osisID="Jas.2.21" n="21" />Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
<verse eID="Jas.2.21" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.22" osisID="Jas.2.22" n="22" />Do you see that faith was the moving principle in his works, and by works his faith was made perfect?
<verse eID="Jas.2.22" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.23" osisID="Jas.2.23" n="23" />And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness: and he was called the friend of God.
<verse eID="Jas.2.23" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.24" osisID="Jas.2.24" n="24" />Do you see that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only?
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Jas.2.24" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.25" osisID="Jas.2.25" n="25" />Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and sent them out another way?
<verse eID="Jas.2.25" />
<verse sID="Jas.2.26" osisID="Jas.2.26" n="26" />For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

<verse eID="Jas.3.1" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.2" osisID="Jas.3.2" n="2" />For in many things we all offend. If any one offends not in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.
<verse eID="Jas.3.2" />

<verse eID="Jas.3.5" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.6" osisID="Jas.3.6" n="6" />And the tongue is a fire, the world of iniquity. So is the tongue placed among our members, defiling the whole body, setting on fire the course of life, and being set on fire by hell.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="Jas.3.6" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.7" osisID="Jas.3.7" n="7" />For every kind of beasts and of birds, of creeping things and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by man:
<verse eID="Jas.3.7" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.8" osisID="Jas.3.8" n="8" />but the tongue no man can tame; it is an unruly evil; it is full of deadly poison.

<verse eID="Jas.3.9" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.10" osisID="Jas.3.10" n="10" />Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing. These things, my brethren, ought not so to be.

<verse sID="Jas.3.11" osisID="Jas.3.11" n="11" />Does a fountain send forth from the same cavern sweet water and bitter?

<verse eID="Jas.3.14" />
<verse sID="Jas.3.15" osisID="Jas.3.15" n="15" />This wisdom comes not from above, but is earthly, animal, demoniac.

<verse sID="Jas.4.6" osisID="Jas.4.6" n="6" />But he gives more grace. Wherefore he says: God sets himself against the proud, but gives grace to the lowly.
<verse eID="Jas.4.6" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.7" osisID="Jas.4.7" n="7" />Submit yourselves, therefore, to God; resist the devil, and he will flee from you;
<verse eID="Jas.4.7" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.8" osisID="Jas.4.8" n="8" />draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded men.
<verse eID="Jas.4.8" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.9" osisID="Jas.4.9" n="9" />Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to sorrow.

<verse sID="Jas.4.10" osisID="Jas.4.10" n="10" />Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.

<p>
<verse eID="Jas.4.10" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.11" osisID="Jas.4.11" n="11" />Do not speak evil one of another, brethren. He that speaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.
<verse eID="Jas.4.11" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.12" osisID="Jas.4.12" n="12" />There is one law-giver that is able to save, and to destroy: who are you that judge another?

<verse eID="Jas.4.13" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.14" osisID="Jas.4.14" n="14" />and yet you know not what will take place to-morrow. For what is your life? Is it not, indeed, a vapor, that appears for a little while, and then vanishes away?
<verse eID="Jas.4.14" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.15" osisID="Jas.4.15" n="15" />Instead of that, you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
<verse eID="Jas.4.15" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.16" osisID="Jas.4.16" n="16" />But now you glory in your boastings: all such glorying is evil.
<verse eID="Jas.4.16" />
<verse sID="Jas.4.17" osisID="Jas.4.17" n="17" />Therefore, to him that knows how to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.

<verse sID="1Pet.1.2" osisID="1Pet.1.2" n="2" />elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctification of the Spirit, in order to obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: grace be to you, and peace be multiplied.

<verse eID="1Pet.1.3" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.4" osisID="1Pet.1.4" n="4" />in respect to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for us,

<verse sID="1Pet.1.5" osisID="1Pet.1.5" n="5" />who are kept secure by the power of God through faith, to a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time:
<verse eID="1Pet.1.5" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.6" osisID="1Pet.1.6" n="6" />in which you rejoice, though now for a little while, since it is needful, you are in sorrow under various temptations;
<verse eID="1Pet.1.6" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.7" osisID="1Pet.1.7" n="7" />that your faith, when proved, being much more precious than gold, which perishes though it be tried by fire, may be found to be for praise and honor and glory, at the revelation of Jesus Christ;

<verse sID="1Pet.1.8" osisID="1Pet.1.8" n="8" />-whom, though you have not seen him, yet you love; on whom not now looking, but believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory,

<verse eID="1Pet.1.9" />
<verse sID="1Pet.1.10" osisID="1Pet.1.10" n="10" />Concerning which salvation the prophets that prophesied of the grace that should be for you, did inquire, and search diligently,

<verse sID="1Pet.4.1" osisID="1Pet.4.1" n="1" />Since, then, Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, do you also arm yourselves with the same determination; for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
<verse eID="1Pet.4.1" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.2" osisID="1Pet.4.2" n="2" />so that he no longer lives the rest of his time in the flesh, according to the desires of men, but according to the will of God.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.2" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.3" osisID="1Pet.4.3" n="3" />For the time past of our life should be enough for us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, while we walked in licentiousness, lusts, drunkenness, revelings, drinkings, and unlawful idolatries.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.3" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.4" osisID="1Pet.4.4" n="4" />They are amazed at this―that you run not with them into the same excess of debauchery, and they revile you.

<verse eID="1Pet.4.5" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.6" osisID="1Pet.4.6" n="6" />For this cause, indeed, even those who have died had the gospel preached to them, that though they might be judged according to the will of men in the flesh, yet they might live according to the will of God in the spirit.

<verse eID="1Pet.4.6" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.7" osisID="1Pet.4.7" n="7" />But the end of all things is at hand; be sober-minded, therefore, and watchful, that you may pray.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.7" />

<verse eID="1Pet.4.8" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.9" osisID="1Pet.4.9" n="9" />Be hospitable, one to another, without murmuring.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.9" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.10" osisID="1Pet.4.10" n="10" />As each has received a gift, minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.10" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.11" osisID="1Pet.4.11" n="11" />If any man speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God: if any man acts as a deacon, let him do this as from the strength which God supplies; that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and strength from age to age. Amen.

<verse eID="1Pet.4.11" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.12" osisID="1Pet.4.12" n="12" />Beloved, be not amazed at the fiery trial that has come on you to try you, as if some strange thing had happened to you.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.12" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.13" osisID="1Pet.4.13" n="13" />But, inasmuch as you are partakers of the sufferings of the Christ,, rejoice, that, at the revelation of his glory, you may also be exceedingly joyful.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.13" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.14" osisID="1Pet.4.14" n="14" />If you are reproached on account of Christ, happy are you: for the glorious Spirit of God rests upon you. On their part he is reviled, but on your part he is glorified:
<verse eID="1Pet.4.14" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.15" osisID="1Pet.4.15" n="15" />for no one of you should suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.15" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.16" osisID="1Pet.4.16" n="16" />But if any one suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this account.
<verse eID="1Pet.4.16" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.17" osisID="1Pet.4.17" n="17" />For the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it begin first at us, what shall be the end of those who obey not the gospel of God?
<verse eID="1Pet.4.17" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.18" osisID="1Pet.4.18" n="18" />And if the righteous man is hardly saved, where shall the ungodly man and the sinner appear?
<verse eID="1Pet.4.18" />
<verse sID="1Pet.4.19" osisID="1Pet.4.19" n="19" />Wherefore, let those also who suffer according to the will of God, by doing good, commit their souls to him as to a faithful Creator.

<p>
<verse sID="2Pet.1.1" osisID="2Pet.1.1" n="1" />Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained faith, equally as precious as our own, in the plan of justification <transChange type="added">revealed by</transChange> our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
<verse eID="2Pet.1.1" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.2" osisID="2Pet.1.2" n="2" />grace be to you, and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgment of God, and Jesus our Lord.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Pet.1.2" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.3" osisID="2Pet.1.3" n="3" />As his divine power has given us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the acknowledgment of him who has called us by his glorious power,
<verse eID="2Pet.1.3" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.4" osisID="2Pet.1.4" n="4" />through which things very great and precious favors that were promised have been given us, that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through desire:
<verse eID="2Pet.1.4" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.5" osisID="2Pet.1.5" n="5" />so, even for this very purpose, uniting to these things all diligence, add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge;
<verse eID="2Pet.1.5" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.6" osisID="2Pet.1.6" n="6" />and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness;

<verse eID="2Pet.1.7" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.8" osisID="2Pet.1.8" n="8" />For if these things be in you, and abound, they cause you to be neither idle, nor unfruitful as it respects the acknowledgment of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.8" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.9" osisID="2Pet.1.9" n="9" />But he who is wanting in these things is blind, and closes his eyes, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.9" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.10" osisID="2Pet.1.10" n="10" />Wherefore, brethren, give the greater diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you will never fall.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.10" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.11" osisID="2Pet.1.11" n="11" />For thus will an entrance be given you abundantly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

<verse eID="2Pet.1.12" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.13" osisID="2Pet.1.13" n="13" />Indeed, I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to arouse you by putting you in remembrance.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.13" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.14" osisID="2Pet.1.14" n="14" />For I know that the putting off of this my tabernacle is near at hand, even as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.14" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.15" osisID="2Pet.1.15" n="15" />But I will earnestly endeavor that you may be able, even after my decease, to have these things always in remembrance.
</p>
<p>
<verse eID="2Pet.1.15" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.16" osisID="2Pet.1.16" n="16" />For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; but we were eye-witnesses of his majesty.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.16" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.17" osisID="2Pet.1.17" n="17" />For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came to him from the magnificent glory a voice, such as this: This is my beloved Son, in whom I delight.
<verse eID="2Pet.1.17" />
<verse sID="2Pet.1.18" osisID="2Pet.1.18" n="18" />And this voice, which came from heaven, we heard when we were with him in the holy mount;

<verse sID="2Pet.1.20" osisID="2Pet.1.20" n="20" />knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture came from private interpretation:
<verse eID="2Pet.1.20" />

<verse eID="2Pet.2.1" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.2" osisID="2Pet.2.2" n="2" />and many will follow their dissolute ways, on account of whom the way of truth will be reviled;

<verse sID="2Pet.2.3" osisID="2Pet.2.3" n="3" />and, with delusive words, they will, through covetousness, make gain of you: the condemnation, long ago denounced against these, delays not, and their destruction does not slumber.

<verse sID="2Pet.2.6" osisID="2Pet.2.6" n="6" />and if, turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, he condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example to those who should afterward live in an ungodly manner,

<verse eID="2Pet.2.12" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.13" osisID="2Pet.2.13" n="13" />and receive the reward of unrighteousness. Counting it a pleasure to riot in the day-time, they are spots and stains, rioting in their delusions, while feasting with you;

<verse eID="2Pet.2.18" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.19" osisID="2Pet.2.19" n="19" />While they promise them freedom, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for by whatever any man is overcome, he is also enslaved.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.19" />
<verse sID="2Pet.2.20" osisID="2Pet.2.20" n="20" />For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in these, and overcome by them, the last state of such is worse than the first.
<verse eID="2Pet.2.20" />

<verse eID="2Pet.3.9" />
<verse sID="2Pet.3.10" osisID="2Pet.3.10" n="10" />But the day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth, and the works that are on it, shall be burned up.

<verse sID="1John.1.1" osisID="1John.1.1" n="1" />That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled concerning the Word of life;
<verse eID="1John.1.1" />
<verse sID="1John.1.2" osisID="1John.1.2" n="2" />(the life also was manifested, and we have seen, and do testify, and declare to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)

<verse sID="1John.1.3" osisID="1John.1.3" n="3" />that which we have seen and heard, we declare it to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

<verse eID="1John.1.5" />
<verse sID="1John.1.6" osisID="1John.1.6" n="6" />If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.
<verse eID="1John.1.6" />
<verse sID="1John.1.7" osisID="1John.1.7" n="7" />But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin.

<verse eID="1John.1.7" />
<verse sID="1John.1.8" osisID="1John.1.8" n="8" />If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

<verse sID="1John.2.1" osisID="1John.2.1" n="1" />My little children, I write these things to you, that you may not sin: and yet, if any one sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
<verse eID="1John.2.1" />
<verse sID="1John.2.2" osisID="1John.2.2" n="2" />And he is the expiation for our sins: not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.

<verse eID="1John.2.3" />
<verse sID="1John.2.4" osisID="1John.2.4" n="4" />He that says, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

<verse sID="1John.2.7" osisID="1John.2.7" n="7" />Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word, which you have heard from the beginning.
<verse eID="1John.2.7" />
<verse sID="1John.2.8" osisID="1John.2.8" n="8" />Again, a new commandment I do write to you, which is true as it respects him and you; because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.

<verse eID="1John.2.14" />
<verse sID="1John.2.15" osisID="1John.2.15" n="15" />Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
<verse eID="1John.2.15" />
<verse sID="1John.2.16" osisID="1John.2.16" n="16" />For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
<verse eID="1John.2.16" />
<verse sID="1John.2.17" osisID="1John.2.17" n="17" />And the world and its desire passes away: but he that does the will of God, abides forever.

<verse eID="1John.2.18" />
<verse sID="1John.2.19" osisID="1John.2.19" n="19" />They went out from us, but they were not of us: for, if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.

<verse sID="1John.3.8" osisID="1John.3.8" n="8" />He that works sin is of the devil, for the devil sins from the beginning: for this purpose was the son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
<verse eID="1John.3.8" />

<verse eID="1John.3.9" />
<verse sID="1John.3.10" osisID="1John.3.10" n="10" />By this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whoever does not work righteousness is not of God; neither is he that loves not his brother.
<verse eID="1John.3.10" />
<verse sID="1John.3.11" osisID="1John.3.11" n="11" />For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.

<verse sID="1John.3.12" osisID="1John.3.12" n="12" />Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and slew his brother: and for what reason did he slay him? because his own works were evil, and his brother s, righteous.
<verse eID="1John.3.12" />

<verse sID="1John.3.14" osisID="1John.3.14" n="14" />We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren: he that loves not his brother, abides in death.
<verse eID="1John.3.14" />
<verse sID="1John.3.15" osisID="1John.3.15" n="15" />Whoever hates his brother, is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

<verse eID="1John.3.16" />
<verse sID="1John.3.17" osisID="1John.3.17" n="17" />Whoever has this world’s goods, and sees his brother have need, and shuts his heart against him, how dwells the love of God in him?

<verse eID="1John.4.1" />
<verse sID="1John.4.2" osisID="1John.4.2" n="2" />By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, is from God:

<verse sID="1John.4.3" osisID="1John.4.3" n="3" />and whatever spirit confesses not that Jesus Christ came in the flesh, is not from God: and this is the spirit of antichrist, of which you have heard that it comes, and is now already in the world.

<verse eID="1John.4.11" />
<verse sID="1John.4.12" osisID="1John.4.12" n="12" />No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.
