\p
\v 1 The former record I made, Theophilus, of all things that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
\v 2 till the day on which he was taken up, after he had, through the Holy Spirit, given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen.
\v 3 To whom, after he had suffered, he also showed himself alive, by many indubitable proofs; appearing to them for forty days, and speaking of the things that pertain to the kingdom of God.
\v 4 And calling them together, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of my Father, which, \add said he,\add* you have heard from me;
\v 5 for John indeed immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit, not many days hence.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, when they came together, they asked him, saying: Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
\v 7 But he said to them: It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has reserved under his own control.
\v 8 But you shall receive power, after the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses for me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the most distant part of the earth.
\p
\v 9 And when he had spoken these things, while they were looking on him, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.
\v 10 And while they were looking earnestly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white raiment,
\v 11 who also said: Men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall come in the same manner in which you saw him go into heaven.
\p
\v 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day’s journey.
\v 13 And when they had come in, they went up into an upper room, in which dwelt Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphæus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.
\v 14 All these, with one mind, continued in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
\p
\v 15 And in those days Peter arose in the midst of the disciples, (the number of the names together was about a hundred and twenty,) and said:
\p
\v 16 Brethren, it was necessary for this scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit had before spoken by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who was a guide to those who took Jesus:
\v 17 for he was numbered with us, and had been appointed to this ministry.
\v 18 Therefore he purchased a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
\v 19 And it was known to all that dwelt in Jerusalem, so that the field is called, in their own language, Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.
\v 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no one dwell in it, and, His office let another take.
\v 21 Therefore, of these men who have associated with us during the whole time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
\v 22 beginning from the immersion of John till the day on which he was taken up from us, must one be appointed as a witness with us of his resurrection.
\p
\v 23 And they set apart two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias;
\v 24 and praying, they said: Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, make known which of these two thou hast chosen,
\v 25 that he may be appointed to this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.
\v 26 And they gave in their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias: and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

\p
\v 1 And when the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one consent in one place.
\v 2 And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of a rushing, violent wind, and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting.
\v 3 And there appeared to them tongues like fire, which distributed themselves, and sat one on each of them.
\v 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
\p
\v 5 Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem devout Jews, from every nation under heaven.
\v 6 When the report of this had gone abroad, the multitude came together; and they were perplexed, for each one heard them speak in his own language.
\v 7 They were amazed and astonished, and said one to another: Are not all these that are speaking, Galileans?
\v 8 And how is it that we hear, every one in our own language in which we were born―
\v 9 Parthians and Modes and Elamites, and we who dwell in Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
\v 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, Roman residents, Jews and proselytes,
\v 11 Cretes and Arabians―we hear them speaking, in our own tongues, the wonderful works of God?
\v 12 And they were all in amazement and doubt, and said, one to another: What can this mean?
\v 13 But others deriding, said: They are full of new wine.
\p
\v 14 But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them: Men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you, and give ear to my words.
\v 15 For these men are not drunk, as you suppose: for it is the third hour of the day.
\v 16 But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:
\p
\v 17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.
\v 18 And also on my servants and on my handmaids, I will pour out of my Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy.
\v 19 And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath, blood and fire and columns of smoke.
\v 20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and terrible day of the Lord comes.
\v 21 And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
\p
\v 22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, clearly pointed out to you as a man from God, by mighty deeds and wonders and signs, which God did by him in your midst, as you yourselves also know,
\v 23 him, delivered up by the fixed purpose and foreknowledge of God, you took, and with wicked hands did crucify and slay:
\v 24 whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held in subjection by it.
\v 25 For David speaks with reference to him: I saw the Lord always in my presence: for he is at my right hand, that I should not be moved.
\v 26 Therefore my heart rejoiced, and my tongue sang praise. Moreover, my flesh shall rest in hope;
\v 27 because thou wilt not leave my soul in hades, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
\v 28 Thou didst make known to me the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
\p
\v 29 Brethren, I may say to you plainly of the patriarch David, that he died, and was buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.
\v 30 Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that he would cause one from the fruit of his loins to sit on his throne;
\v 31 foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul was not left in hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
\v 32 This Jesus has God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.
\v 33 Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from his Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.
\v 34 For David has not ascended into the heavens; but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
\v 35 till I make thy enemies thy footstool.
\v 36 Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made this same Jesus whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
\p
\v 37 When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles: Brethren, what shall we do?
\p
\v 38 And Peter said to them: Repent, and be immersed, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, in order to the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\v 39 For the promise is to you, and your children, and to all that are afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.
\v 40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying: Save yourselves from this wicked generation.
\p
\v 41 Then they that gladly received his word were immersed, and on that day there were added to them about three thousand souls.
\v 42 And they attended constantly to the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of bread, and the prayers.
\v 43 And fear came on every soul; and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
\v 44 And all that believed were together, and had all things in common;
\v 45 and they sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, as each had need.
\v 46 And with one consent, they continued daily in the temple; and, breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,
\v 47 praising God, and being in favor with all the people. And the Lord added the saved daily to the Church.

\p
\v 1 Now Peter and John were going up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, which was the ninth hour.
\v 2 And a certain man, lame from his mother’s womb, was carried along, whom they laid daily at that gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, that he might ask charity of those who were going into the temple.
\v 3 This man, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked charity.
\v 4 But Peter, fixing his eyes on him with John, said: Look on us.
\v 5 And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them.
\p
\v 6 But Peter said: Silver and gold I have none: but what I have, this I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, arise and walk.
\v 7 And he took him by his right hand and raised him up: and immediately his feet and ankles received strength.
\v 8 And leaping up, he stood and walked, and went with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.
\v 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God;
\v 10 and they recognized him, that it was he that had sat for charity at the Beautiful gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
\p
\v 11 And while he was holding to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch called Solomon’s, greatly astonished.
\v 12 But when Peter saw it, he answered the people:
\p Men of Israel, why are you astonished at this? or, why do you look so earnestly on us, as if by our own power or godliness we had caused this man to walk?
\v 13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus, whom you delivered up, and whom you rejected in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to release him.
\v 14 But you rejected the Holy and Just One, and demanded that a murderer should be given to you;
\v 15 and you slew the Author of life, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
\v 16 And his name, by faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you see and know; even the faith which is by him, has given him this entire soundness in the presence of you all.
\p
\v 17 And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance you did this, as did also your rulers.
\v 18 But the things which God foretold by the mouth of all his prophets, that the Christ should suffer, he has thus fulfilled.
\v 19 Repent, therefore, and turn, in order that your sins may be blotted out, so that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,
\v 20 and that he may send Jesus Christ, who was destined for you;
\v 21 whom heaven must retain, till the time for restoring all things that God has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets of ancient times.
\p
\v 22 For Moses said to the fathers, A prophet like me shall the Lord your God raise up for you from among your brethren; him shall you hear in all things that he shall say to you.
\v 23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul that will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
\v 24 And all the prophets, from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days.
\v 25 You are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
\v 26 To you first, God, having raised up his Son Jesus, has sent him to bless you, in turning every one of you away from his iniquities.

\p
\v 1 While they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came upon them,
\v 2 being vexed because they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
\v 3 And they laid hands on them, and put them in prison till the next day, for it was already evening.
\v 4 But many of those who heard the word, believed: and the number of the men was about five thousand.
\p
\v 5 And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers and elders and scribes,
\v 6 and Annas the chief priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the chief priest, met together in Jerusalem.
\v 7 And when they had made them stand in the midst, they asked: By what power, or by what name have you done this?
\v 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
\v 9 if we are this day examined with respect unto the good deed done to the infirm man, by what means he has been saved,
\v 10 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him does this man stand before you in health.
\v 11 This is the stone that was rejected with contempt by you builders, which has become the head of the corner.
\v 12 And there is salvation in no other; nor, indeed, is there another name under heaven, given among men, by which we must be saved.
\p
\v 13 Now, when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and plain men, they were astonished; and they also recognized them, that they had been with Jesus;
\v 14 and, seeing the man who had been cured standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.
\v 15 But, having commanded them to go aside out of the Sanhedrim, they consulted with one another,
\v 16 saying: What shall we do with these men? For that an evident sign has been done by them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem, and we can not deny it.
\v 17 But that it may spread no further among the people, let us severely threaten them, so that they speak no more to any man in this name.
\v 18 And they called them in, and commanded them to speak no more at all, nor to teach, in the name of Jesus.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and John answering them, said: Whether it is right in the sight of God to obey you rather than God, judge you.
\v 20 For we can not but speak the things that we have seen and heard.
\v 21 And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing for which they could punish them, because of the people; for they all glorified God on account of that which had been done;
\v 22 for the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.
\p
\v 23 And having been released, they went to their own, and told all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
\v 24 And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice with one consent to God, and said: Lord, thou art God, who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things that are in them; who, by the mouth of David thy servant, didst say,
\v 25 Why did the heathen rage, and the people devise vain things?
\v 26 The kings of the land stood up, and the rulers met together against the Lord and against his anointed.
\v 27 For, in truth, against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, did meet together,
\v 28 to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel determined to be done.
\v 29 And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and grant to thy servants that they may speak thy word with all boldness,
\v 30 by stretching out thy hand to heal, that both signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy child Jesus.
\p
\v 31 And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.
\p
\v 32 And the multitude of believers were of one heart and of one soul; and no one said that any part of his possessions was his own; but they had all things in common.
\v 33 And with great power did the apostles bear testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all.
\v 34 Nor, indeed, was there any needy person among them; for as many as were owners of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the prices of what had been sold,
\v 35 and laid them down at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to every one as he had need.
\p
\v 36 And Joses, who, by the apostles, was surnamed Barnabas, (which name, when translated, is, Son of consolation,) a Levite, by birth a Cyprian,
\v 37 having land, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
\c 5

\p
\v 1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
\v 2 and kept back part of the price, and his wife was conscious of it; and he brought a certain part of it, and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
\v 3 But Peter said: Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart, that you should attempt to deceive the Holy Spirit, and keep back part of the price of the land?
\v 4 While it remained \add unsold\add*, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your own disposal? Why have you purposed this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.
\v 5 And when Ananias heard these words, he fell down, and expired. And great fear came on all that heard these things.
\v 6 And the young men arose and wound him in his mantle, and carried him out, and buried him.
\p
\v 7 And after an interval of about three hours, his wife, not knowing what had been done, came in.
\v 8 And Peter answered her: Tell me, did you sell the land for so much? She replied: Yes; for so much.
\v 9 But Peter said to her: Why is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out.
\v 10 And she immediately fell down at his feet, and expired. And the young men came in and found her dead; and they carried her out, and buried her by the side of her husband.
\v 11 And great fear came on all the church, and on all that heard these things.
\p
\v 12 And many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles; (and they were all with one consent in Solomon’s porch.
\v 13 And no one of the rest durst join himself to them; but the people magnified them.
\v 14 And believers in the Lord were more and more added to them, multitudes both of men and women;)
\v 15 so that they brought the sick out along the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that even the shadow of Peter, as he passed along, might fall on some of them.
\v 16 And many people of the cities round about came to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and those who were troubled by evil spirits, all of whom were cured.
\p
\v 17 But the chief priest arose, and all that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation;
\v 18 and they laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the public prison.
\v 19 But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison by night, and brought them out, and said:
\v 20 Go, stand in the temple, and speak to the people all the words of this life.
\v 21 And having heard this, they entered the temple, early in the morning, and taught. But the chief priest, and those who were with him, came and called together the Sanhedrim, and all the eldership of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
\p
\v 22 But when the attendants came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and reported,
\v 23 saying: We found the prison closed with all safety, and the guards standing before the doors; but when we had opened, we found no one within.
\v 24 When the priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt about them, what this could mean.
\v 25 And some one came and reported to them: Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
\p
\v 26 Then went the captain with the attendants, and brought them without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.
\v 27 And when they had brought them, they made them stand before the Sanhedrim; and the chief priest asked them,
\v 28 saying: Did we not strictly charge you not to teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
\p
\v 29 But Peter and the apostles answered and said: We must obey God rather than men.
\v 30 The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom you slew by hanging him on a tree.
\v 31 Him has God exalted to his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, in order to give to Israel repentance and remission of sins:
\v 32 and we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit also, whom God has given to them that obey him.
\p
\v 33 And when they heard this, they were enraged; and they determined to put them to death.
\v 34 Then arose a certain man in the Sanhedrim, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people; and he commanded them to put the apostles out for a little while,
\v 35 and said to them: Men of Israel, consider well with yourselves what you are about to do to these men.
\v 36 For before these days Theudas arose, declaring himself to be some great one; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves; and he was slain; and all, as many as believed him, were scattered and brought to naught.
\v 37 After this man, Judas the Galilean arose, in the days of the enrollment, and drew over many people after him; and he was destroyed, and all, as many as believed him, were scattered.
\v 38 And now I say to you, keep away from these men, and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to an end;
\v 39 but if it is of God, you can not bring it to an end: and take heed, lest you be found fighting also against God.
\p
\v 40 And they were persuaded by him; and when they had called the apostles in and scourged them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
\v 41 Then, they went from the presence of the Sanhedrim, rejoicing that they were thought worthy to suffer shame for his name’s sake.
\v 42 And daily in the temple, and from house to house, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus the Christ.
\c 6
\cl VI.
\p
\v 1 In those days, when the disciples were increasing in number, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
\v 2 And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said: It is not right that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
\v 3 Therefore, brethren, select from among yourselves seven men, of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business:
\v 4 but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
\p
\v 5 And the speech pleased the whole multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch,
\v 6 whom they set before the apostles. And when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
\p
\v 7 And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was greatly multiplied; and a great multitude of the priests became obedient to the faith.
\p
\v 8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
\v 9 Then there arose some who belonged to the synagogue called the synagogue of the Freedmen, and some of the Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and of those who were from Cilicia and Asia, and they disputed with Stephen.
\v 10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke.
\v 11 Then they instigated men to say: We have heard him speak impious words against Moses, and against God.
\p
\v 12 And they excited the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and took him by violence, and brought him into the Sanhedrim.
\v 13 And they brought forward false witnesses, who said: This man ceases not to speak words against this holy place, and the law.
\v 14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
\v 15 And all that sat in the Sanhedrim, looking earnestly upon him, saw his face that it was like the face of an angel.
\c 7
\cl VII.
\p
\v 1 And the chief priest said: Are these things so?
\v 2 He replied: Brethren and fathers, hear: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
\v 3 and said to him: Get out from your land, and from your kindred, and come into a land that I will show you.
\v 4 Then he departed from the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran; and thence, after his father died, he removed into this land, in which you now dwell.
\v 5 And he gave him no inheritance in it, not a foot breadth: and yet he promised to give it for a possession to him, and to his posterity after him, when as yet he had no child.
\p
\v 6 And God spoke thus: That his posterity should sojourn in a strange land, and they should enslave them and afflict them, for four hundred years.
\v 7 And the nation to which they shall be in bondage I will judge, said God; and after that, they shall come forth and serve me in this place.
\v 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and thus he begot Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot the twelve patriarchs.
\p
\v 9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
\v 10 and delivered him from all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharoah, king of Egypt: and he made him governor over Egypt, and his whole house.
\v 11 And there came a famine, and great affliction on the whole land of Egypt, and of Chanaan: and our fathers found no sustenance.
\v 12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time:
\v 13 and, on their second visit, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and the kindred of Joseph were made known to Pharaoh.
\v 14 And Joseph sent and called to him his father Jacob, and all his kindred, seventy-five souls.
\v 15 And Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, himself and our fathers;
\v 16 and they were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher which Abraham bought for its value in silver, from the sons of Emmor, the father of Sychem.
\p
\v 17 And as the time of the promise which God had made with an oath to Abraham drew near, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,
\v 18 till another king arose, who knew not Joseph.
\v 19 He dealt insidiously with our race, and afflicted our fathers, so that they exposed their infants, in order that they might not live.
\p
\v 20 At which time Moses was born; and he was exceedingly beautiful, and was nursed three months in his father’s house.
\v 21 But having been exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up, and educated him as her own son.
\v 22 And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
\v 23 When he had completed his fortieth year, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.
\v 24 And seeing one of them unjustly treated, he defended and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian.
\v 25 And he supposed that his brethren would understand that, by his hand, God would give them salvation: but they understood not.
\p
\v 26 And on the next day he showed himself to them, as they were fighting, and endeavored to persuade them to peace, saying, Men, you are brothers: why do you injure one another?
\v 27 But he that was doing the injury to his neighbor, thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler or a judge over us?
\v 28 Do you intend to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?
\v 29 And at that saying Moses fled, and became a resident in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons.
\v 30 And when forty years were completed, there appeared to him, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
\v 31 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight, and as he was drawing near to observe it, the voice of the Lord came to him:
\v 32 I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not observe it.
\v 33 Then said the Lord to him: Loose your shoes from your feet; for the place in which you stand is holy ground.
\v 34 I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them; and now come, and I will send you into Egypt.
\p
\v 35 This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? him God sent as a ruler and as a redeemer, by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
\v 36 He brought them out, after he had performed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness, forty years.
\v 37 This is that Moses, who said to the sons of Israel, A prophet like me will the Lord your God raise up for you from among your brethren; him shall you hear.
\p
\v 38 This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers; he received the living oracles, that he might give them to us.
\v 39 To him our fathers were not willing to be obedient; but they rejected him, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,
\v 40 saying to Aaron: Make us gods that shall go before us; for, as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.
\v 41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
\v 42 But God turned and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: Your victims and your sacrifices did you offer to me for forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
\v 43 Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your God Remphan, images which you made to worship; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
\p
\v 44 The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, \add built\add* as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to build it, according to the pattern which he had seen:
\v 45 which our fathers, who were with Joshua, received by succession, and brought into the land possessed by the Gentiles, whom God continued to drive out from the face of our fathers till the -days of David,
\v 46 who found favor before God, and desired to find a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob.
\v 47 But Solomon built him a house.
\v 48 Yet the Most High dwells not in temples made with hands, as says the prophet:
\v 49 Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What house will -you build me? says the Lord; or what is the place of my rest?
\v 50 Has not my hand made all these things?
\p
\v 51 You stiff-necked, and uncircumcised in heart and in ears, you do always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so also do you.
\v 52 Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? They slew also those who foretold the coming of the Just One, of whom you have now become the betrayers and murderers;
\v 53 who received the law by the appointment of angels, and have not kepi, it.
\p
\v 54 When they heard these things, they were enraged in their hearts, and gnashed upon him with their teeth.
\v 55 But being full of the Holy Spirit, he looked earnestly up into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;
\v 56 and he said: Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.
\p
\v 57 And they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and, with one consent, rushed upon him,
\v 58 and drove him out of the city, and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man called Saul.
\v 59 And they stoned Stephen while he was calling on \add the Lord\add*, and saying: Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
\v 60 And he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice: Lord, let not this sin stand against them. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. And Saul was well pleased with his death.
\c 8
\cl VIII.
\p
\v 1 And at that time there was a great persecution against the church that was in Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
\v 2 But devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
\v 3 But Saul attempted to destroy the church; entering every house, and dragging men and women, he delivered them up to prison.
\p
\v 4 Then they that were dispersed went everywhere preaching the word.
\v 5 And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached the Christ to them.
\v 6 And the multitudes with one mind gave heed to the things which were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.
\v 7 For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them, and many paralytics and lame persons were cured.
\v 8 And there was great joy in that city.
\p
\v 9 But there was a certain man, named Simon, who had, before this time, been practicing magic in the city, and astonishing the people of Samaria, saying that he was some great one;
\v 10 to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the great power of God.
\v 11 And they gave heed to him because he had, for a long time, astonished them with his magic arts.
\v 12 But when they believed Philip, who preached the good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were immersed, both men and women.
\v 13 And Simon himself also believed; and after he was immersed, he continued with Philip; and, seeing the mighty deeds and the signs which were done, he was astonished.
\p
\v 14 Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John;
\v 15 who, when they had gone down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 16 For he had not yet fallen on any of them; only they had been immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 17 Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 18 And when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, he offered them money,
\v 19 saying: Give me, also, this authority, that whoever I shall lay my hands on, may receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 20 But Peter said to him: Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God might be purchased with money.
\v 21 You have neither part nor share in this matter; for your heart is not right in the sight of God.
\v 22 Repent, therefore, of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the purpose of your heart may be forgiven you.
\v 23 For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.
\v 24 But Simon answered and said: Pray you both to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken come upon me.
\p
\v 25 Then, when they had given their testimony, and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
\p
\v 26 And an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, and go toward the south, to the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza; this is desert.
\v 27 And he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
\v 28 was returning, and, sitting in his chariot, read the prophet Isaiah.
\p
\v 29 And the Spirit said to Philip: Go forward and join yourself to this chariot.
\v 30 And Philip ran forward, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah; and he said: Do you understand what you are reading?
\v 31 He answered: How can I, unless some one instruct me? And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
\v 32 The passage of the scripture which he was reading, was this: As a sheep for the slaughter was he led; and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so opened he not his mouth
\v 33 in his humiliation. The sentence against him was taken away; but who shall describe the men of his generation? For his life was taken from the earth.
\v 34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said: I pray you, of whom speaks the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other man?
\v 35 And Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached to him Jesus.
\p
\v 36 And as they went along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water; what hinders me from being immersed?
\v 38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he immersed him.
\v 39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.
\v 40 But Philip was found at Azotus, and, passing through, he preached the gospel in all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea
\c 9
\cl IX.
\p
\v 1 And Saul, still breathing out threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the chief priest,
\v 2 and asked of him letters to Damascus, for the synagogues, that, if he should find any who were of this persuasion, either men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus; and suddenly there shone round about him a light from heaven.
\v 4 And when he had fallen to the earth, he heard a voice saying to him: Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?
\v 5 He answered: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said: I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
\v 6 But rise, and go into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.
\v 7 The men who journeyed with him stood amazed; for they heard a voice, but saw no one.
\v 8 And Saul arose from the earth, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no one; but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
\v 9 And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
\p
\v 10 Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision: Ananias. He answered: Behold me, Lord.
\v 11 And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the street that is called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus: for behold, he is praying;
\v 12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias, coming in and laying his hand on him, that he may receive his sight.
\v 13 But Ananias answered: Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints in Jerusalem;
\v 14 and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name.
\v 15 But the Lord said to him: Go; for he is a vessel chosen by me to bear my name before nations and kings, and the sons of Israel.
\v 16 For I will show him what great things he must suffer for my name.
\p
\v 17 And Ananias went, and entered the house, and laying his hands on him, said: Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
\v 18 And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he instantly received his sight; and he arose, and was immersed.
\v 19 And, having taken food, he was strengthened.
\p And he was with the disciples in Damascus for some days;
\v 20 and immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Sou of God.
\v 21 And all that heard him were astonished, and said: Is not this he who destroyed in Jerusalem those that call on this name, and who has come hither for this purpose, that he might carry them bound to the chief priests?
\v 22 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confuted the Jews that dwelt in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
\v 23 And, after many days had passed, the Jews determined to kill him.
\v 24 And their plot was made known to Saul; and they watched the gates day and night, that they might kill him.
\v 25 But the disciples took him by night, and let him down through the vail in a basket,
\p
\v 26 And having come to Jerusalem, he attempted to associate with the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.
\v 27 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and told them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had boldly preached in Damascus in the name of Jesus.
\v 28 And he was with them in Jerusalem, coming in and going out; and, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus,
\v 29 he conversed and reasoned with the Hellenists; but they undertook to kill him.
\v 30 And when the brethren learned this, they brought him down to Cæsarea, and sent him out to Tarsus.
\p
\v 31 Then the churches throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.
\p
\v 32 And it came to pass that Peter, passing through all the places, came down also to the saints that dwelt in Lydda.
\v 33 And he found there a certain man named Æneas, who was a paralytic, and had kept his bed for eight years.
\v 34 And Peter said to him: Æneas, Jesus the Christ restores you to health; arise, and spread your bed for yourself. And he immediately arose;
\v 35 and all that dwelt in Lydda and Saron saw him; and they turned to the Lord.
\p
\v 36 Now there was in Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which name, when translated, is Dorcas. She was full of good works and deeds of charity which she did.
\v 37 And it came to pass, in those days, that she was taken sick, and died. And when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.
\v 38 And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, requesting him to make no delay in coming to them.
\p
\v 39 Then Peter arose, and went with them; and when he had come, they brought him into the upper room; and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.
\v 40 But Peter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said: Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
\v 41 And he gave her his hand, and raised her up. And when he had called in the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.
\v 42 And it was known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.
\v 43 And it came to pass, that he remained many days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.
\c 10
\cl X.
\p
\v 1 Now there was a certain man in Cæsarea, named Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,
\v 2 a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who did many acts of charity to the people, and prayed to God always.
\v 3 He distinctly saw, in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
\p
\v 4 And having looked steadily on him, he was afraid, and said: What is it, Lord? He said to him: Your prayers and your charitable deeds have come up for a memorial before God.
\v 5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter;
\v 6 he lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea.
\v 7 When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier, one of those who waited on him,
\v 8 and having made known all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
\p
\v 9 And on the morrow, as they were going on their journey, and were drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.
\v 10 And he became very hungry, and desired to eat; but while they were making ready, he fell into a trance;
\v 11 and he saw heaven opened, and some vessel, like a great sheet, descending, bound by the four corners, and let down to the earth.
\v 12 In this were all kinds of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the air.
\v 13 And there came a voice to him: Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
\v 14 But Peter said: By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing common or unclean.
\v 15 And the voice came to him again a second time: What God has cleansed, you must not call common.
\v 16 This was done the third time; and the vessel was taken up again into heaven.
\p
\v 17 Now, while Peter was perplexed within himself about the meaning of the vision which he had seen, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius, having made inquiry for the house of Simon, stood before the gate.
\v 18 And they called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodged there.
\v 19 While Peter was thinking of the vision, the Spirit said to him: Behold, three men ask for you:
\v 20 arise then, and go down, and go with them without hesitation, for I have sent them.
\p
\v 21 And Peter came down to the men, and said: Behold, I am he whom you seek; what is the cause of your coming?
\v 22 They replied: Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God, and of good report among the whole nation of the Jews, was instructed by a holy angel to call you to his house, and to hear words from you.
\v 23 Then he called them in, and lodged them.
\p On the morrow he arose, and went with them; and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
\v 24 And on the next day, they entered Cæsarea And Cornelius was expecting them, and had called together his relatives and near friends.
\v 25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and did him homage.
\v 26 But Peter raised him up, saying: Stand up; I also am a man.
\v 27 And; conversing with him, he went in, and found many that had come together.
\p
\v 28 And he said to them: You know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with one of another nation, or to go into his house. But God has showed me that I must not call any man common or unclean.
\v 29 For this reason, when I was sent for, I came without making objection. I ask, therefore, for what purpose have you sent for me?
\v 30 And Cornelius replied: Four days ago, I was fasting till this hour; and, at the ninth hour, I was praying in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
\v 31 and said: Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your deeds of charity are remembered before God.
\v 32 Send, therefore, to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter: he lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea; who, when he comes, will speak to you.
\v 33 Therefore, I immediately sent to you; and you have done well in coming. Now, therefore, we are all here present before God, to hear all things that are given in charge to you by God.
\p
\v 34 And Peter opened his mouth, and said: In truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;
\v 35 but, in every nation, he that fears him and works righteousness is accepted by him.
\v 36 The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, (he is Lord of all,)
\v 37 that word, you know, which was published through the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the immersion that John preached;
\v 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit, and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.
\v 39 And we are witnesses of all that he did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew by hanging him on a tree.
\v 40 Him God raised up the third day, and caused him to appear,
\v 41 not to all the people, but to witnesses who were before appointed by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him, after he rose from the dead.
\p
\v 42 And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that this is he who has been appointed by God as the judge of the living and the dead.
\v 43 To him all the prophets bear testimony, that whoever believes on him shall receive remission of sins through his name.
\p
\v 44 While Peter was speaking these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all that heard the word.
\v 45 And the believers that were of the circumcision, as many as had come with Peter, were astonished, because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit:
\v 46 for they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then Peter answered:
\v 47 Can any one forbid the water, that these should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?
\v 48 And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then they besought him to remain some days.
\c 11
\cl XI.
\p
\v 1 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judea, heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
\v 2 And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,
\v 3 saying: You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them.
\p
\v 4 And Peter began, and laid the matter before them in order, saying:
\v 5 I was in the city of Joppa, praying; and, while in a trance, I saw a vision, some vessel like a great sheet, descending, let down from heaven by the four corners; and it came even to me.
\v 6 When I had looked attentively into it, I observed and saw four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts and creeping things and birds of the air.
\v 7 And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
\v 8 But I said, By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.
\v 9 But the voice answered me a second time from heaven, What God has cleansed, you must not call common.
\v 10 This was done the third time, and all was drawn up again into heaven.
\p
\v 11 And behold, three men who had been sent to me from Cæsarea, immediately came to the house where I was.
\v 12 And the Spirit commanded me to go with them without hesitation. And these six brethren accompanied me. And we entered the man’s house:
\v 13 and he told us how he had seen an angel in his house, standing and saying to him, Send to Joppa and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter;
\v 14 he will tell you words by which you and all your house shall be saved.
\p
\v 15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
\v 16 Then I remembered the word of the Lord, as he said, John immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit.
\v 17 If, then, God gave them the like gift that he gave to us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I, that I could withstand God?
\v 18 And when they heard these things, they ceased to contend; and they glorified God, saying: Then, indeed, has God given to the Gentiles also repentance in order to life.
\p
\v 19 Now those who had been dispersed by the persecution that arose after the death of Stephen, traveled as far as Phenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none but Jews.
\v 20 But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.
\v 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.
\p
\v 22 And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church that was in Jerusalem; and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.
\v 23 When he had come, and had seen the grace of God, he rejoiced; and he exhorted them all to remain, with purpose of heart, faithful to the Lord.
\v 24 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great multitude was added to the Lord.
\p
\v 25 And Barnabas went to Tarsus, to seek for Saul;
\v 26 and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that they met together in the church for a whole year, and taught a great multitude; and the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.
\p
\v 27 In those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.
\v 28 And one of them, named Agabus, rose and made known, by the Spirit, that a great famine was about to come on the whole habitable land; which took place in the days of Claudius.
\v 29 And every one of the disciples determined, as he had the means, to send relief to the brethren that dwelt in Judea;
\v 30 which also they did; and they sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
\c 12
\cl XII.
\p
\v 1 At that time Herod the king undertook to afflict some of the church.
\v 2 And he slew with the sword James the brother of John.
\p
\v 3 And when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he apprehended Peter also. Those were the days of unleavened bread.
\v 4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four tetrads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the passover.
\v 5 Therefore, Peter was kept in prison; but fervent prayer to God was made for him by the church.
\p
\v 6 When Herod was about to bring him out, on that night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and the keepers before the doors were guarding the prison.
\v 7 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison. And he gently struck Peter on the side, and awoke him, saying: Arise quickly; and his chains fell from his hands.
\v 8 And the angel said to him: Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals; and he did so. And he said to him: Throw your mantle around you, and follow me.
\v 9 And he went out, and followed him; and he knew not that what was done by the angel was real, but thought that he saw a vision.
\p
\v 10 And when they had passed through the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord. And they went out, and passed on through one street; and the angel immediately departed from him.
\v 11 And when Peter came to himself, he said: Now I know, in truth, that the Lord has sent his angel, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod, and from all that was expected by the Jewish people.
\p
\v 12 And being aware of his condition, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, who is surnamed Mark, where many had met together, and were praying.
\v 13 And when he knocked at the door of the entrance, a maidservant, named Rhoda, came to listen.
\v 14 And recognizing Peter’s voice, she did not open the entrance for joy, but ran in and told that Peter was standing before the entrance.
\v 15 And they said to her: You are mad. But she confidently affirmed that it was even so. Then said hey: It is his angel.
\v 16 But Peter continued to knock; and when they had opened the door, they saw him, and were astonished.
\v 17 But, having made a sign to them with his hand, that they should keep silence, he made known to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison, and he said: Tell this to James, and to the brethren. And he went out, and departed to another place.
\p
\v 18 And when it was day, there was no little confusion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.
\v 19 But Herod, when he had sought for him, and found him not, examined the keepers, and commanded them to be put to death. And he went down from Judea to Cesarean, and there he remained.
\p
\v 20 And he was intending to make war upon the Tyrians and Sidonians; but they came with one consent to him; and having made Blastus, who had charge of the king’s bed-chamber, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was supported by that of the king.
\v 21 And on an appointed day, Herod, having arrayed himself in royal apparel, and seated himself on his throne, delivered an oration to them.
\v 22 And the people shouted: It is the voice of God, and not of man.
\v 23 And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he did not give God the glory. And having been eaten by worms, he expired.
\p
\v 24 But the word of the Lord increased and multiplied.
\v 25 And Barnabas and Saul, after they had fulfilled their ministry, returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, whose surname was Mark.
\c 13
\cl XIII.
\p
\v 1 Now there were certain prophets and teachers in the church that was at Antioch; Barnabas, and Simeon, who is called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, who was brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
\v 2 And while they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said: Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, to the work to which I have called them.
\v 3 Then, after they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
\p
\v 4 Therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and thence sailed to Cyprus.
\v 5 And while they were in Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogue of the Jews; and they had John as their attendant.
\p
\v 6 And having gone through the island as far as Paphos, they found a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar-jesus;
\v 7 and he was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, who was a man of intelligence. This man called for Barnabas and Saul, and expressed an earnest wish to hear the word of God.
\v 8 But the magician Elymas (for this is his name, when translated) withstood them, desiring to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
\v 9 Then Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, and looking earnestly upon him,
\v 10 said: full of all deceit and all wickedness, child of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
\v 11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness, and he went about and sought some to lead him by the hand.
\v 12 Then the proconsul, seeing what was done, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.
\p
\v 13 And Paul and his companions put to sea from Paphos, and went to Perga in Pamphylia. But John withdrew from them, and returned to Jerusalem.
\v 14 But having passed through from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia; and on the sabbath-day they went into the synagogue, and sat down.
\v 15 After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying: Brethren, if you have a word of exhortation for the people, speak.
\p
\v 16 Then Paul arose, and waving his hand, said: Men of Israel, and you who fear God, give audience.
\v 17 The God of this people chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he brought them out from it.
\v 18 And for about forty years, he cherished them in the wilderness.
\v 19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land among them by lot.
\v 20 And after that he gave them judges, for about four hundred and fifty years, till Samuel the prophet.
\p
\v 21 And afterward they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
\v 22 And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom he gave this testimony: I have found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart, who will do all my will.
\v 23 From the posterity of this man, God, according to his promise, raised up for Israel a Savior, Jesus;
\v 24 John having first preached, before his coming, the immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel.
\p
\v 25 And as John was finishing his course, he said: Who do you suppose that I am? I am not he; but behold, there is coming after me one, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.
\v 26 Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
\v 27 For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know him, nor the words of the prophets, which are read every sabbath-day, have fulfilled them in condemning him.
\v 28 And though they found no cause of death, yet they demanded of Pilate that he should be slain.
\v 29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulcher.
\v 30 But God raised him from the dead.
\v 31 And he was seen for many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
\p
\v 32 And we preach to you good news concerning the promise made to our fathers,
\v 33 that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, by raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second Psalm: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
\v 34 But that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus: I will give you the sure mercies of David.
\v 35 For which reason he says also in another Psalm: Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
\v 36 For David, after serving the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption.
\v 37 But he whom God raised up did not see corruption.
\p
\v 38 Be it known to you, therefore, brethren, that through this man is preached to you the remission of sins:
\v 39 and by him, every one that believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
\v 40 Take heed, therefore, lest that which is spoken in the prophets come upon you:
\v 41 Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish. For I work a work in your days, a work which you will not believe, though one fully declare it to you.
\p
\v 42 And as they were departing from the synagogue, they were requested to speak these things to them on the next sabbath.
\v 43 Now, after the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them, and persuaded them to continue faithful to the grace of God.
\v 44 And on the next sabbath-day, almost the whole city met together to hear the word of God.
\p
\v 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and reviling.
\v 46 But Paul and Barnabas, speaking boldly, said: It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first: but since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo! we turn to tho Gentiles.
\v 47 For thus has the Lord given us commandment: I have placed thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be for salvation to the most distant part of the earth.
\p
\v 48 When the Gentiles heard this they rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were determined to obtain eternal life, believed.
\v 49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout the whole of that region.
\v 50 But the Jews in cited the devout and influential women, and the first men of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their borders.
\v 51 But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and went to Iconium.
\v 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
\c 14
\cl XIV.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude of the Jews and Greeks believed.
\v 2 But the unbelieving Jews excited and embittered the minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.
\v 3 Therefore, they continued a long time, and spoke boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, by granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
\p
\v 4 But the multitude of the city were divided; and some were with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
\v 5 But when there was a violent purpose on the part of the Gentiles and of the Jews, with their rulers, to outrage and to stone them,
\v 6 being aware of it, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and to the region round about,
\v 7 and there they preached the gospel.
\p
\v 8 And there was a certain man in Lystra, without strength in his feet, who sat, for he was a cripple from his mother’s womb, and had never walked.
\v 9 This man heard Paul speak, who, looking earnestly on him, and seeing that he had faith to be saved,
\v 10 said, with a loud voice: Stand erect upon your feet. And he leaped and walked.
\v 11 When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, and said, in the Lycaonian language: The Gods have come down to us in the likeness of men.
\v 12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter, and Paul, Mercury, for he was the chief speaker.
\p
\v 13 Then the priest of Jupiter, whose temple was before the city, having brought bulls and garlands to the entrance, intended to offer sacrifice, with the multitudes.
\v 14 But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the multitude, crying out,
\v 15 and saying: Men, why are you doing these things? We also are human beings, with passions like your own, and we preach the gospel to you, that you may turn from these vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them;
\v 16 who, in past generations, permitted all the nations to walk in their own ways;
\v 17 and yet he did not leave himself without testimony, doing good, and giving you rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
\v 18 And with these words they hardly restrained the multitudes from offering sacrifice to them.
\p
\v 19 Then came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews, who persuaded the multitudes; and having stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
\v 20 But while the disciples were standing around him, he arose, and went into the city.
\p And on the next day, he departed with Barnabas to Derbe;
\v 21 and when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,
\v 22 strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, that through many afflictions we mast enter the kingdom of God.
\v 23 And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
\v 24 And having passed through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia;
\v 25 and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia:
\v 26 thence they sailed to Antioch, from which place they had been commended to the grace of God, for the work which they had accomplished.
\p
\v 27 And having come and called together the church, they reported all that God had done with them, and that he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
\v 28 And they continued a long time with the disciples.
\c 15
\cl XV.
\p
\v 1 And certain men came down from Judea, and taught the brethren, saying: Unless you be circumcised, according to the custom of Moses, you can not be saved.
\v 2 Therefore, after Paul and Barnabas had no little dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others from among them, should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.
\v 3 Being, therefore, con ducted on their journey by the church, they passed through Phenicia and Samaria, making known the conversion of the Gentiles; and they gave great joy to all the brethren.
\v 4 When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and the apostles and elders, and they declared all that God had done with them.
\v 5 But some of the sect of the Pharisees, who believed, arose, saying, that it was necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.
\p
\v 6 And the apostles and elders came together to deliberate about this matter.
\v 7 And after there had been much disputing, Peter arose, and said to them: Brethren, you know that, at the beginning, God made choice among us, that, by my mouth, the Gentiles should hear the word of the Gospel, and believe.
\v 8 And God, who knows the heart, became a witness for them, by giving them the Holy Spirit, as he gave it also to us;
\v 9 and he made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
\v 10 Now, therefore, why do you put God to the proof, by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers, nor we ourselves, were able to bear?
\v 11 But we believe that we shall be saved, even as they, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they made known what signs and wonders God had done by them among the Gentiles.
\p
\v 13 And after they were silent, James answered and said: Brethren, hear me;
\v 14 Simeon has declared how God, at the first, did visit the Gentiles, in order to take out from among them a people for his name.
\v 15 And with this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
\v 16 After this I will return, and build again the tabernacle of David which has fallen down; and I will build again its ruins, and I will set it up;
\v 17 that the rest of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name has been called, says the Lord, who does all these things.
\v 18 Known to God from eternity are all bis works.
\v 19 For these reasons, my judgment is, that we give no trouble to those who, from among the Gentiles, have turned to God;
\v 20 but that we write to them to abstain from pollutions of idols, and from lewdness, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
\v 21 For, from ancient times, Moses has, in every city, those who preach him, being read in the synagogue every sabbath-day.
\p
\v 22 Then it pleased the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to send to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, chosen men from among themselves; Judas, who was surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren;
\v 23 and they wrote by their hands as follows:
\p The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:
\v 24 Inasmuch as we have heard that certain persons went out from us and troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, That you must be circumcised, and keep the law, to whom we gave no commandment,
\v 25 it has seemed good to us, having come together with one mind, to send chosen men to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
\v 26 men who have endangered their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 27 We have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, who will tell you the same things in word.
\v 28 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
\v 29 That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from lewdness; from which if you keep yourselves carefully, you will do well. Farewell.
\p
\v 30 So when these men were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and having assembled the multitude, they delivered this letter.
\v 31 When they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation which it gave.
\v 32 And Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and strengthened them.
\v 33 And after spending some time, they were dismissed in peace from the brethren, to those who had sent them.
\v 34 But it pleased Silas to remain there.
\v 35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching, with many others, the word of the Lord.
\p
\v 36 And, after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, let us return, and visit our brethren in every city in which we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.
\v 37 And Barnabas determined to take with him John, whose surname was Mark.
\v 38 But Paul did not think it proper to take with them him who had departed from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work.
\v 39 There was, therefore, a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other: and Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus.
\v 40 But Paul chose Silas, and departed, having been commended to the grace of God by the brethren.
\v 41 And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
\c 16
\cl XVI.
\p
\v 1 And he came to Derbe and Lystra; and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess, who was a believer; but his father was a Greek.
\v 2 A good report was given of him by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.
\v 3 This man Paul wished to go with him: and he took him and circumcised him, on account of the Jews that were in those places: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
\v 4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees that had been resolved on by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, that they might keep them.
\v 5 Therefore, the churches were established in the faith, and they increased in number daily.
\p
\v 6 When they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,
\v 7 and had come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit did not permit them.
\v 8 But having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
\v 9 And, during the night, a vision appeared to Paul. A certain man of Macedonia stood and besought him, saying: Come over to Macedonia and help us.
\v 10 After he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavored to go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.
\p
\v 11 Therefore, setting sail from Troas, we came by a straight course to Samothracia, and, on the following day, to Neapolis,
\v 12 and thence to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony. We remained in that city some days:
\v 13 and on the sabbath-day we went out of the city to the side of a river, where, as usual, was the house of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
\v 14 And a certain woman, named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, heard; whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things that were spoken by Paul.
\v 15 And when she and her household had been immersed, she besought us, saying: If you judge me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and make it your home. And she con strained us.
\p
\v 16 And it came to pass, that as we were going to the house of prayer, there met us a certain maid-servant that had a spirit of Python, who brought much gain to her masters, by giving responses.
\v 17 She followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying: These men are the servants of the most High God, who show us the way of salvation.
\v 18 And this she continued to do for many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit: I command you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.
\p
\v 19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the market to the rulers.
\v 20 And having brought them to the magistrates, they said: These men, who are Jews, do greatly trouble our city;
\v 21 and they teach customs which it is not lawful for us, who are Romans, to receive or to observe.
\v 22 And the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates stripped off their clothes, and gave command to beat them with rods.
\v 23 And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, and charged the jailer to keep them securely.
\v 24 And having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
\p
\v 25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sung a hymn to God; and the prisoners were listening to them.
\v 26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bonds were loosed.
\v 27 And the jailer, being aroused from sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison open, drew his sword, and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.
\v 28 But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying: Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.
\p
\v 29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and trembling, he fell down before Paul and Silas;
\v 30 and, having brought them out, he said: Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
\v 31 They replied: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you and your house shall be saved.
\v 32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all that were in his house.
\v 33 And he took them at that hour of the night, and washed the blood from their stripes; and he was immersed, himself and all his, immediately.
\v 34 And he brought them into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God, with all his house.
\p
\v 35 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the lictors, saying: Release those men.
\v 36 And the jailer told these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent to release you. Now, therefore, come out, and go in peace.
\v 37 But Paul said to them: Having publicly scourged us uncondemned, us who are Romans, they threw us into prison: and do they now put us out secretly? No, verily: but let them come and lead us out.
\v 38 And the lictors told these words to the magistrates: and they were alarmed when they heard that they were Romans;
\v 39 and they came, and entreated them, and led them out, and requested them to depart from the city.
\v 40 And having come out of the prison, they went into the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
\c 17
\cl XVII.
\p
\v 1 And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
\v 2 And Paul, according to his custom, went in to them, and, for three sabbath-days, he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
\v 3 explaining and affirming that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead; and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.
\v 4 And some of them believed, and associated themselves with Paul and Silas; of the devout Greeks, a great multitude, and of the chief women, not a few.
\p
\v 5 But the unbelieving Jews, taking with them some evil men, who were loungers about the markets, and collecting a mob, set the city in an uproar; and having assaulted the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.
\v 6 But not finding them, they dragged Jason and certain brethren before the rulers of the city, crying out: These men, who have thrown the world into confusion, have come hither also;
\v 7 whom Jason has received into his house: and they all act in opposition to the decrees of Cæsar, saying, That there is another king, Jesus.
\v 8 And the multitude, and the rulers of the city, were troubled when they heard these things.
\v 9 And they took security of Jason, and of the others, and let them go.
\p
\v 10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea; and when they had come, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
\v 11 These were of a better disposition than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.
\v 12 Therefore, many of them believed; both of influential women, who were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
\v 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul in Berea also, they came thither, and excited the multitude.
\v 14 Then the brethren immediately sent Paul away, to go as if to the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.
\v 15 And those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens: and having received a commandment for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
\p
\v 16 Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he saw the city full of idols.
\v 17 Accordingly, he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and devout persons, and in the market daily, with those who chanced to meet him.
\v 18 And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers disputed with him; and some said: What can this babbler possibly wish to say? Others said: He seems to be a proclaimer of strange demons: for he preached to them Jesus and the Resurrection.
\v 19 And they took him, and brought him to Mars hill, saying: Are we able to understand what this new teaching is, which is announced by you?
\v 20 For you bring some strange things to our ears: we wish to understand then what these things mean.
\v 21 For all the Athenians and resident strangers have leisure for nothing else than to tell or to hear some new thing.
\p
\v 22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars hill, and said: Men of Athens, I perceive that in all respects your reverence for demons excels that of other men.
\v 23 For as I was passing through, and looking attentively at the objects of your worship, I dis covered also an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him I make known to you.
\v 24 God, who made the world, and all things that are in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;
\v 25 nor is he ministered to by the hands of men, as if he needed any thing: for he himself gives to all life, and breath, and all things:
\v 26 and he has made from one blood every nation of men, that they might dwell on all the face of the earth, having marked out their appointed times, and the bounds of their dwelling:
\v 27 that they might seek for God, if perhaps they would feel after him, and find him, although, indeed, he is not far from every one of us.
\v 28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being: as also some of your own poets have said: For we his offspring are.
\p
\v 29 Therefore, being the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhood is like gold, or silver, or stone, sculptured by art and the device of man.
\v 30 Yet the times of this ignorance God overlooked; but now, he commands all men everywhere to repent:
\v 31 because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world, in righteousness, by the man whom he has chosen, giving to all assurance of this, by having raised him from the dead.
\p
\v 32 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; others said: We will hear you again concerning this matter.
\v 33 And so Paul departed from among them.
\v 34 But certain men associated with him, and believed; among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
\c 18
\cl XVIII.
\p
\v 1 After these things, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
\v 2 and finding a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had lately come from Italy, with Priscilla his wife, because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome, he went to them;
\v 3 and because he was of the same trade, he made his home with them, and worked: for by trade they were tent-makers.
\v 4 But on every sabbath, he reasoned in the synagogue, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
\v 5 And when Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul was roused in spirit, and earnestly testified to the Jews, that-the Christ was Jesus.
\p
\v 6 But when they set themselves in opposition, and reviled, he shook his clothing, and said to them: Your blood be upon your own head; I am clean. Henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.
\v 7 And he departed thence, and went into the house of a certain man named Justus, who worshiped God, and whose house joined the synagogue.
\v 8 But Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were immersed.
\v 9 And the Lord spoke to Paul by a vision in the night: Fear not; but speak, and be not silent;
\v 10 for I am with you, and no one shall make an assault upon you, to injure you; for I have many people in this city.
\v 11 And he remained there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them
\p
\v 12 But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews, with one mind, suddenly came upon Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat,
\v 13 saying: This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.
\v 14 But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: If it were a matter of injustice, or of wicked mischief, O Jews, I would, with reason, bear with you:
\v 15 but if it is a question about a word, and names, and your law, see to it yourselves: for I will not be a judge of these tilings.
\v 16 And he drove them from the judgment-seat.
\v 17 And all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.
\p
\v 18 And Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the brethren, and sailed to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea; for he had a vow.
\v 19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself went into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
\v 20 And though they besought him to remain with them a longer time, he did not consent,
\v 21 but took leave of them, saying: I must, by all means, keep this coming feast in Jerusalem: but I will return to you, if God be willing. And he sailed from Ephesus,
\v 22 and having landed at Cæsarea, and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
\v 23 And having spent some time there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
\p
\v 24 And a certain Jew, named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.
\v 25 He was instructed in the way of the Lord; and, being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord, knowing only the immersion of John.
\v 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him, and taught him the way of God more accurately.
\v 27 And when he wished to pass into Achaia, the brethren, exhorting him, wrote to the disciples to receive him. And when he had come, he gave much help to the believers, through the grace conferred on him.
\v 28 For, with great strength, he utterly confounded the Jews publicly, showing, by the Scriptures, that the Christ was Jesus.
\c 19
\cl XIX.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, after passing through the upper districts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples,
\v 2 said to them: Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed? They said to him: \add We have not only not received it,\add* but we have not even heard whether the Holy Spirit is given.
\v 3 And he said to them: Into what, then, were you immersed? They replied: Into John’s immersion.
\v 4 And Paul said: John immersed with the immersion of repentance, saying to the people, that they must believe on him who should come after him, that is, on the Christ, Jesus.
\v 5 And when they heard this, they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 6 And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.
\v 7 And all the men were about twelve.
\p
\v 8 And he entered the synagogue, and spoke boldly, reasoning, and persuading them for three months, with respect to the things of the kingdom of God.
\v 9 But as some were hardened, and did not believe, and spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he withdrew from them, and separated the disciples, and discoursed daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
\v 10 This continued for two years; so that all that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
\v 11 Mighty deeds, also, that were unusual, did God perform by the hands of Paul;
\v 12 so that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried from his body to the sick, and diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits came out of them.
\p
\v 13 And some of the roving Jews, who were exorcists, undertook to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying: I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.
\v 14 And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.
\v 15 But the evil spirit answered and said: Jesus I acknowledge, and Paul I know; but who are you?
\v 16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled from that house, naked and wounded.
\v 17 And this became known to all the Greeks and Jews that dwelt in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
\v 18 And many of those who believed came and confessed, and made known their practices.
\v 19 And many of those who practiced magic, brought together their books, and burned them, in the presence of all. And they computed their value, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
\v 20 So mightily did the word of the Lord grow and prevail.
\p
\v 21 When these things had been accomplished, Paul purposed in spirit to go to Jerusalem, after he should pass through Macedonia and Achaia, saying: After I have been there, I must see Rome also.
\v 22 So, having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he remained for a time in Asia.
\p
\v 23 And at that time there was no little excitement about that way.
\v 24 For a certain man, named Demetrius, a silversmith, by making silver shrines for Diana, furnished no little trade to the artists.
\v 25 These he called together, with the workmen employed about such things, and said: Men, you know that our wealth arises from this trade:
\v 26 and you see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost the whole of Asia, this Paul, by his persuasions, has drawn away a great multitude, saying, that they which are made with hands are not gods.
\v 27 Now there is danger, not only that this our calling will come into disgrace, but that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be despised, and that the majesty of her whom all Asia and the world worships, will be destroyed.
\p
\v 28 When they heard this, they were full of anger, and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!
\v 29 And the whole city was filled with confusion. And they seized Gains and Aristarchus, who were Macedonians, Paul’s fellow-travelers, and, with one consent, rushed into the theater.
\v 30 And when Paul wished to go in among the people, the disciples did not permit him.
\v 31 Some of the Asiarchs also, who were friendly to him, sent to him, and besought him not to trust himself into the theater.
\v 32 Some, therefore, were crying one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not for what they had come together.
\v 33 And some of the multitude put Alexander forward, the Jews urging him on. And Alexander waved his hand, and wished to make a defense to the people.
\v 34 But perceiving that he was a Jew, they all cried out, with one voice, for about two hours: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
\p
\v 35 But the town-clerk quieted the multitude, and said: Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great Diana, and of the image that fell down from Jupiter?
\v 36 As these things, then, can not be contradicted, you ought to be quiet, and do nothing rashly.
\v 37 For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples, nor revilers of your goddess.
\v 38 Therefore, if Demetrius, and the artists who are with him, have a charge against any one, the courts are in session, and the proconsuls are there; let them accuse each other.
\v 39 But if you have any inquiries to make about other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
\v 40 For we are in danger of being called to answer for this day’s tumult, since there is no cause by which we shall be able to account for this concourse.
\v 41 And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
\c 20
\cl XX.
\p
\v 1 After the tumult had ceased, Paul called the disciples to him, and bade them farewell, and departed, in order to go into Macedonia.
\v 2 And when he had gone through those regions, and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece.
\v 3 And having remained there three months, he determined to return through Macedonia, because a plot had been laid for him by the Jews, as he was about to sail to Syria.
\v 4 And Sopater of Berea, and Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy and Tychicus and Trophimus, who were Asiatics, accompanied him to Asia.
\v 5 These went before, and waited for us at Troas.
\v 6 But we sailed from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we remained seven days.
\p
\v 7 And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, intending to depart on the morrow; and he continued his speech till midnight.
\v 8 And there were many lamps in the upper room, in which they had met together.
\v 9 And a certain young man, named Eutychus, was sitting in the window, overpowered with deep sleep: and, as Paul was discoursing a long time, being oppressed with sleep, he fell from the third story, and was taken up dead.
\v 10 But Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him, said: Be not troubled, for his life is in him.
\v 11 And he went up again, and broke bread, and ate; and having conversed a long time, till daylight, he thus departed.
\v 12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
\p
\v 13 And we went on before to the ship, and put to sea for Assos, intending to take Paul on board at that place; for he had so directed, intending to go himself on foot.
\v 14 And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board, and came to Mitylene;
\v 15 and sailing from that place, we came, on the following day, opposite to Chios; and, on the next day, we arrived at Samos: and after stopping at Trogyllium, we came, on the next day, to Miletus.
\v 16 For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not spend time in Asia; for he hastened, that, if it were possible for him, he might be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
\p
\v 17 From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
\v 18 And when they had come to him, he said to them: You know, from the first day on which I came into Asia, how I have been with you during the whole time,
\v 19 serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials, which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;
\v 20 and that I have kept back nothing that was profitable, but have preached to you, and taught you both publicly, and from house to house,
\v 21 bearing full testimony both to Jews and to Greeks, of the repentance that leads to God, and of the faith that leads to our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 22 And now, behold, I am going, bound in spirit, to Jerusalem, not knowing what shall befall me there,
\v 23 except that in every city the Holy Spirit testifies to me, saying, That bonds and afflictions await me.
\v 24 But I esteem this a matter of no importance, nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry that I have received from the Lord Jesus, to bear full testimony to the gospel of the grace of God.
\v 25 And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.
\v 26 For this reason I solemnly affirm to you this day, that I am clean from the blood of all men.
\v 27 For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God.
\p
\v 28 Therefore, take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, that you be shepherds to the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.
\v 29 For I know this, that, after my departure, rapacious wolves will enter in among you, who will not spare the flock;
\v 30 and men will arise from among yourselves, speaking perverse things, that they may draw off disciples after them.
\v 31 Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, by day and by night, I ceased not to warn every one of you with tears.
\v 32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace; to Him who is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all the sanctified.
\v 33 I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
\v 34 You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me.
\v 35 In all things I have taught you by ex ample, that by thus laboring, you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus; for he himself said, It is more blessed to give, than to receive.
\p
\v 36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.
\v 37 And they all wept much, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
\v 38 grieving most of all for the word he had spoken, that they would see his face no more. And they conducted him to the ship.
\c 21
\cl XXI.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass that, after we had separated from them, we put to sea, and came by a straight course to Cos, and on the following day, to Rhodes, and thence to Patara.
\v 2 And finding a ship that was going to Phenicia, we embarked, and put to sea.
\v 3 And we came in view of Cyprus; and, leaving it to the left, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to put off her lading.
\v 4 And we remained there seven days, after finding the disciples. These urged Paul, by the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 5 And when these days were completed, we went forth, and continued our journey, they all, with their wives and children, conducting us out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
\v 6 And when we had bid each other farewell, we embarked, and they returned home.
\p
\v 7 And completing the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais: and having saluted the brethren, we remained with them one day.
\v 8 On the following day we departed, and came to Cæsarea, and went into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven; and we remained with him.
\v 9 This man had four virgin daughters, who had the gift of prophesy.
\p
\v 10 And as we remained there many days, there came down, from Judea, a certain prophet, named Agabus;
\v 11 and he came to us, and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own hands and feet, and said: Thus says the Holy Spirit; the Jews that are in Jerusalem will so bind the man to whom this girdle belongs; and they will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
\v 12 And when we heard these things, we, and those of that place also, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 13 But Paul answered: What do you effect by weeping, and breaking my heart? For I am ready, not only to be bound, but also to suffer death in Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 14 And as he would not be persuaded, we kept silence, and said: The will of the Lord be done.
\p
\v 15 And after these days we prepared for our journey, and went up to Jerusalem.
\v 16 There went with us also some of the disciples from Cæsarea, who took with them, Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
\p
\v 17 And when we came to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
\v 18 And, on the following day, Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
\v 19 And when he had saluted them, he related, in every particular, the things which. God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.
\p
\v 20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him: You see, brother, how many myriads of the Jews there are that believe, and they are all zealous for the law.
\v 21 And they have heard it reported of you, that you teach all the Jews that are among the Gentiles to apostatize from Moses; commanding them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.
\v 22 What, then, is to be done? A multitude must certainly come together; for they will hear that you have come.
\v 23 Do, therefore, this which we advise you. We have four men who have a vow on them.
\v 24 Take them, and join with them in their vow of abstinence, and pay their expenses, in order that they may shave their heads; and all will know that the things which they have heard reported of you are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.
\v 25 But with respect to the Gentiles that believe, we have written; having decided that they should observe no such thing; but that they keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from lewdness.
\p
\v 26 Then Paul took the men, and, on the following day, joining in their vow of abstinence, he entered the temple, and gave notice when the days of abstinence would be completed, at which time an offering should be made for each of them.
\p
\v 27 And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, threw all the multitude into confusion, and laid their hands on him,
\v 28 crying out: Men of Israel, help! this is the man who teaches all men every where against this people, and the law, and this place: and besides, he has even brought Greeks into the temple, and defiled this holy place.
\v 29 For, before this time, they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.
\v 30 And the whole city was moved; and the people ran together, and, seizing Paul, they dragged him out of the temple, and the gates were immediately closed.
\p
\v 31 And while they were seeking to kill him, report was brought to the officer of the band, that the whole of Jerusalem was in an uproar.
\v 32 And he immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. When they saw the officer and the soldiers, they ceased beating Paul.
\v 33 Then the officer came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
\v 34 And some in the multitude cried out one thing, and some another. But not being able to obtain any certain knowledge on account of the tumult, he commanded him to be led into the fortress.
\v 35 And when he was on the steps, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers, on account of the violence of the multitude.
\v 36 For the greater part of the people followed, crying out: Away with him!
\p
\v 37 But as Paul was about to be led into the fortress, he said to the officer: May I speak to you? He replied: Do you understand Greek?
\v 38 Are you not that Egyptian, who, before these days, made an insurrection, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men of the Assassins?
\v 39 But Paul replied: I am a Jew of Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen of no unknown city; and I beseech you, permit me to speak to the people.
\v 40 And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing upon the steps, waved his hand to the people. And when there was great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:
\c 22
\cl XXII.
\p
\v 1 Brethren and fathers, hear my defense, which I now make before you.
\v 2 When they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they kept the greater silence. And he said:
\v 3 I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, yet educated in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, and instructed according to the strict discipline of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, as you all are this day.
\v 4 And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,
\v 5 as the chief priest and the whole body of elders will testify for me. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring those, also, who were there, bound to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.
\p
\v 6 But it came to pass, that, as I was on my journey, and was drawing near to Damascus, about midday, there suddenly shone from heaven a great light round about me;
\v 7 and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?
\v 8 And I answered, Who art thou Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute.
\v 9 They who were with me saw the light, and were afraid, but did not understand the voice of him who spoke to me.
\v 10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus, and there you shall be told of all things that are appointed for you to do.
\p
\v 11 And as I could not see for the glory of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and went into Damascus.
\v 12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, who had a good report from all the Jews that dwelt there,
\v 13 came to me, and standing by me, said, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And the same hour I looked upon him.
\v 14 And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice of his mouth;
\v 15 for you shall be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.
\v 16 And now, why do you delay? Arise, and be immersed, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass, after I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance,
\v 18 and saw him saying to me, Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.
\v 19 And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I threw into prison, and scourged, in every synagogue, those who believed on thee;
\v 20 and that when the blood of Stephen, thy witness, was shed, I also stood by and approved, and kept the clothing of those who slew him.
\v 21 And he said to me, Depart, for I will send you far off to the Gentiles.
\p
\v 22 And they heard him to this word, and lifted up their voice, saying: Away with such a man from the earth! for it is not fit that he should live.
\v 23 And as they were crying out, and tossing off their clothes, and throwing dust into the air,
\v 24 the officer commanded him to be led into the fortress, and gave orders that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so cried out against him.
\v 25 But Paul said to the centurion who stood by, as he caused him to be bent forward to the straps: Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?
\v 26 And when the centurion heard that, he went out and told it to the officer, saying: What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.
\v 27 And the officer came and said to him: Tell me, are you a Roman? He answered: Yes.
\v 28 And the officer answered: With a great Bum did I purchase this citizenship. And Paul replied: But I was born a citizen.
\v 29 Then, those who were about to examine him, immediately departed from him. And the officer was afraid, when he learned that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
\p
\v 30 And, on the next day, wishing to know certainly why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrim to meet together. And he brought Paul down, and placed him before them.
\c 23
\cl XXIII.
\p
\v 1 And Paul, looking earnestly upon the Sanhedrim, said: Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience toward God to this day.
\v 2 And the chief priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by to smite him on the mouth.
\v 3 Then Paul said to him: God will smite you, you whitened wall! for do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet violate the law by commanding me to be smitten?
\v 4 And those who stood by said: Do you revile God’s chief priest?
\v 5 And Paul replied: I did not know, brethren, that he was the chief priest: for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.
\p
\v 6 But when Paul perceived that one part belonged to the Sadducees, and the other to the Pharisees, he cried out, in the Sanhedrim: Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I judged.
\v 7 And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection; neither angel nor spirit: but the Pharisees acknowledge both. And there arose a great clamor. And the scribes, on the part of the Pharisees, arose and contended, saying:
\v 9 We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
\v 10 And when there arose a great dissension, the officer, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the fortress.
\p
\v 11 And on the following night, the Lord stood by him, and said: Take courage; for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you testify also in Rome.
\p
\v 12 And when it was day, the Jews combined together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
\v 13 And there were more than forty who formed this conspiracy.
\v 14 And they went to the chief priests and elders, and said: We have surely bound ourselves under a curse, that we will taste nothing till we have killed Paul.
\v 15 Now, therefore, do you, together with the Sanhedrim, give notice to the officer, that he bring him down to you to-morrow, as if you intended to inquire more accurately into the matters concerning him: and before he comes near, we are ready to kill him.
\p
\v 16 But the son of Paul’s sister heard of the plot, and he went and entered the fortress, and told Paul.
\v 17 And Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said: Conduct this young man to the officer, for he has something to tell him.
\v 18 So he took him, and led him to the officer, and said: The prisoner Paul called me to him, and requested me to conduct this young man to you; for he has something to tell you.
\v 19 And the officer took him by the hand, and went aside with him privately, and inquired: What is it that you have to tell me?
\v 20 He answered: The Jews have agreed to request you to bring Paul down into the Sanhedrim to-morrow, as if they intended to inquire something more accurately concerning him.
\v 21 Do not, however, be persuaded by them; for more than forty men of them are lying in wait for him; and they have bound themselves under a curse, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for a promise from you.
\v 22 Then the officer sent the young man away, with this charge: Tell no one that you have made these things known to me.
\p
\v 23 And he called to him two centurions, and said: Make ready two hundred soldiers, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, that they may depart to Cæsarea at the third hour of the night.
\v 24 And provide beasts on which they may set Paul, and take him in safety to Felix the governor.
\v 25 And he wrote a letter in this form:
\v 26 Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor, Felix, greeting:
\v 27 This man was taken by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them. Then I went with soldiers, and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
\v 28 But wishing to know the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down into their Sanhedrim.
\v 29 And I found that he was accused about questions of their law, but had nothing worthy of death or of bonds charged against him.
\v 30 And as I was informed that a plot was about to be laid against the man by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, and commanded his accusers to say in your presence what they had against him. Farewell.
\p
\v 31 Then the soldiers took Paul, as they were commanded, and brought him by night to Antipatris.
\v 32 And, on the morrow, they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the fortress.
\v 33 When they came to Cæsarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.
\v 34 And when he had read the letter, he inquired to what province he belonged. And learning that he was from Cilicia, he said: I will hear you when your accusers also have come. And he ordered him to be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.
\v 35
\c 24
\cl XXIV.
\p
\v 1 And after five days, Ananias the chief priest came down with the elders and a certain orator, Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.
\v 2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:
\v 3 Since through you we enjoy great quietness, and since whatever has been undertaken for this nation has been conducted to a successful issue by your foresight at all times and in all places, we accept it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
\v 4 But that I may not detain you longer, I beseech you to hear us, in your clemency, a few words.
\v 5 For we have found this man a pest and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
\v 6 He also attempted to profane the temple; and we took him, and wished to judge him according to our law.
\v 7 But Lysias the officer came, and, with much violence, took him out of our hands,
\v 8 and commanded his accusers to come before you. From him you may be able yourself, by examination, to gain a knowledge of all these tilings of which we accuse him.
\p
\v 9 And the Jews united in accusing him, saying that these things were so.
\p
\v 10 Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: Knowing that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully offer a defense for myself:
\v 11 for you can understand that there are not more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
\v 12 And they found me neither disputing with any one in the temple, nor exciting the multitude in the synagogue, or in the city:
\v 13 nor are they able to prove the things of which they now accuse me.
\v 14 But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call sect, so do I worship the God of my fathers; believing all things that are written in the law and in the prophets;
\v 15 having hope in God, which they themselves also admit, that I there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.
\v 16 And I do exercise myself in this, always to have a conscience void of offense toward God and man.
\p
\v 17 But, after many years, I came to bring charitable gifts to my nation, and offerings.
\v 18 While engaged in these things, certain Jews from Asia found me fulfilling my vow of abstinence in the temple, not with a multitude, nor with tumult.
\v 19 These ought to be here before you, and bring their charge, if they have any, against me.
\v 20 Or let these persons here say, what offensive conduct they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrim,
\v 21 except in this one expression, which I uttered while standing among them: With respect to the resurrection I of the dead, I am judged by you this day.
\p
\v 22 But Felix, having a more accurate knowledge of this way, put them off, and said: When Lysias the officer comes down, I will inquire fully into your matters.
\v 23 And he commanded the centurion to keep him under guard, and to relax the rigor of his confinement, and to forbid no one of his friends to minister or to come to him.
\p
\v 24 And, after some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess; and he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
\v 25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered: For the present withdraw; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.
\v 26 He hoped, at the same time, that money would have been given him by Paul, to release him. For this reason, he sent for him very frequently, and conversed with him.
\p
\v 27 But, after two years, Felix received Portius Festus as his successor; and Felix, wishing to confer a favor on the Jews, left Paul bound.
\c 25
\cl XXV.
\p
\v 1 When Festus, having entered upon his government, after three days went up from Cæsarea to Jerusalem.
\v 2 And the chief priest and first men of the Jews informed him against Paul,
\v 3 and, asking a favor against him, besought him that he would send and have him brought to Jerusalem, laying a plot to kill him on the road.
\v 4 Then Festus answered, that Paul was under guard in Cæsarea, and that he himself would soon depart thither.
\v 5 Therefore, said he, let those among you who are men of influence, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there is any wickedness in him.
\p
\v 6 And he remained among them not more than eight or ten days, and then went down to Cæsarea And, on the next day, he sat upon the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.
\v 7 And when he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around, and brought many and heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove,
\v 8 he answering for himself: Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cæsar, have I committed any offense.
\v 9 But Festus, willing to confer a favor on the Jews, answered Paul, and said: Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me concerning these things?
\v 10 And Paul answered: I am standing at the judgment-seat of Cæsar, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.
\v 11 If, however, I be an offender, and have done any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if the things of which these men accuse me are nothing, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Cæsar.
\v 12 Then Festus, after conferring with the council, answered: To Cæsar have you appealed? To Cæsar you shall go.
\p
\v 13 And after some days, King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Cæsarea, to salute Festus.
\v 14 And as they remained there many days, Festus made known to the king the facts concerning Paul, saying: There is a certain man, who was left in bonds by Felix,
\v 15 concerning whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews informed me, asking for judgment against him.
\v 16 I replied to them, that it is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man up to death, before the accused has had his accusers face to face, and has had an opportunity to answer concerning the charge that is against him.
\v 17 Therefore, when they had come hither with me, I made no delay; but, on the next day, sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
\v 18 And when his accusers stood up, they brought no such charge against him as I expected;
\v 19 but they had certain questions against him, about their own religion, and about a certain Jesus that had died, who, Paul affirmed, was alive.
\v 20 But, being in doubt about the question concerning this man, I asked him if he would go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged with respect to these matters.
\v 21 But when Paul made his appeal, that he should be kept for the judgment of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I could send him to Cæsar
\p
\v 22 And Agrippa said to Festus: I could wish to have heard the man myself. He replied: To-morrow you shall hear him.
\p
\v 23 Therefore, on the morrow, when Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and entered the place of audience, with the officers and principal men of the city, Paul, at the command of Festus, was brought forth.
\v 24 And Festus said: King Agrippa, and all men here present, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews, both in Jerusalem and in this place, have entreated me, crying out, that he ought to live no longer.
\v 25 But finding that he had done nothing worthy of death, and as he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
\v 26 Concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my Lord. For this reason, I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after the examination has been held, I may have something to write.
\v 27 For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to make known the charges that are against him.

\cl XXVI.
\p
\v 1 Then Agrippa said to Paul: You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and answered for himself.
\p
\v 2 I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because I shall this day make my defense before you, concerning all things of which I am accused by the Jews;
\v 3 especially, since you are acquainted with all the customs and questions that are among the Jews. For this reason, I beseech you to hear me patiently.
\p
\v 4 My course of life from my youth, which, from the beginning, was among my own nation in Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
\v 5 who, knowing me from the first, could testify, if they would, that, according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.
\v 6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;
\v 7 to which promise our twelve tribes, zealously serving night and day, hope to come: on account of which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
\v 8 What? Is it thought a thing incredible among you, that God raises the dead?
\p
\v 9 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus the Nazarene.
\v 10 And this I did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I gave my vote against them.
\v 11 And I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled them to speak impiously; and, being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
\p
\v 12 While I was engaged in these things, and was going to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
\v 13 at midday, while I was on the road, I saw, King, a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those who journeyed with me.
\v 14 And when we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying, in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
\v 15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? He replied, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
\v 16 But arise, and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness of the things which you have seen, and of those in which I will appear to you,
\v 17 delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom now I send you,
\v 18 in order to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins, and an inheritance among the sanctified, by faith in me.
\p
\v 19 Wherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;
\v 20 but announced first to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works worthy of repentance.
\v 21 For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple, and endeavored to kill me.
\v 22 Having, therefore, obtained help from God, I have stood till this day, testifying both to small and to great, saying nothing else than the things which the prophets and Moses did say should come to pass:
\v 23 that Christ should suffer, and that he first, by his resurrection from the dead, should show light to the people, and to the Gentiles.
\p
\v 24 And as he spoke these things in his defense, Festus said, with a loud voice; Paul, you are mad; much learning drives you to madness.
\v 25 But he replied: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.
\v 26 For the king has knowledge of these things, before whom, also, I speak with boldness; for I am persuaded that none of these things have escaped his notice; for this was not done in a corner.
\v 27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.
\v 28 Then Agrippa said to Paul: You almost persuade me to be a Christian.
\v 29 And Paul replied: I could pray to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me to-day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.
\p
\v 30 And the king arose, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.
\v 31 And when they had withdrawn, they conversed with one another, saying: This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
\v 32 And Agrippa said to Festus: This man could have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cæsar
\c 27
\cl XXVII.
\p
\v 1 And as it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan band, named Julius.
\v 2 And going on board a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, intending to sail by the coast of Asia, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
\v 3 On the next day, we touched at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with kindness, and permitted him to go to his friends, and receive their attentions.
\v 4 And thence we put to sea, and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were adverse.
\v 5 And when we had sailed across the sea opposite Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
\p
\v 6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy; and he put us on board.
\v 7 For many days we sailed slowly; and having with difficulty come off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to go further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, off Salmone:
\v 8 and coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which is the city of Lasea.
\p
\v 9 But, after much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous, for the fast was already past, Paul admonished them,
\v 10 saying: Men, I perceive that this voyage will be with damage and much loss, not only to the cargo and the ship, but also to our lives.
\v 11 But the centurion had more confidence in the pilot, and in the owner of the ship, than in the things which were spoken by Paul.
\v 12 And as the harbor was not commodious to winter in, the majority advised that they should put to sea from that place also, if, by any means, they might reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a harbor of Crete, lying toward the south-west and north-west.
\p
\v 13 And when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had gained their object, they launched the ship, and ran along close to the shore of Crete.
\v 14 But in a little time a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon, blew against it.
\v 15 And the ship being caught and unable to bear up against the wind, we committed it to the gale, and were driven along.
\v 16 And running under the lee of a certain island called Clauda, we with difficulty secured the boat.
\v 17 When they had taken it up, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they should fall into the quicksand, they lowered the mast, and thus were driven along.
\v 18 And as we were greatly tossed by the tempest, on the next day they threw overboard the cargo;
\v 19 and on the third day, with our own hands, we threw out the tackling of the ship.
\v 20 And as neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay upon us, all hope of our being saved was at length taken away.
\p
\v 21 But, after long abstinence from food, Paul stood up in the midst of them, and said: men, you ought to have been persuaded by me, and not to have put to sea from Crete; and you would have avoided this damage and loss.
\v 22 And now, I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
\v 23 For there stood by me this night an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
\v 24 and said, Fear not, Paul; you must stand in the presence of Cæsar; and behold, God has given you all that are sailing with you.
\v 25 For this reason, men, be cheerful; for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told to me.
\v 26 But we must be thrown upon a certain island.
\p
\v 27 But when the fourteenth night had come, and we were drifting up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors supposed that they were drawing near some land.
\v 28 And they sounded, and found twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, and sounded again, they found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 And fearing that we would fall upon rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern, and wished for day.
\p
\v 30 And as the sailors were attempting to flee from the ship, and were letting down the boat into the sea, under the pretext that they were about to let down anchors from the prow,
\v 31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers: Unless these remain in the ship, you can not be saved.
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
\p
\v 33 And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take food, saying: This is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense, and continued without food, having taken nothing.
\v 34 Wherefore, I exhort you to take food; for this will promote your safety. For not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.
\v 35 And when he had said this, he took bread, and gave thanks to God before them all, and broke, and began to eat.
\v 36 And all became cheerful, and also partook of food.
\v 37 And all of us that were in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six souls.
\v 38 When they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship by throwing the provisions into the sea.
\p
\v 39 And when it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they perceived an inlet, that had an accessible shore, into which they desired, if they could, to thrust the ship.
\v 40 And, after cutting away the anchors, they committed the ship to the sea, at the same time loosing the lashings of the rudders: and they set up the front sail to the wind, and kept the ship firmly toward the shore.
\v 41 And falling into a place where two currents met, they ran the ship aground, and the prow stuck fast, and remained immovable; but the stern was broken by the violence of the waves.
\v 42 The soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest some of them should swim out and escape.
\v 43 But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, to throw themselves into the sea first, and get to land;
\v 44 and then the rest, some on planks, and others on what could be taken from the ship. And thus it came to pass, that all got safe to land.

\p
\v 1 And when they had saved themselves, they then learned that the island was called Melita.
\v 2 And the barbarians showed us no ordinary kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the rain which was falling, and because of the cold.
\p
\v 3 And when Paul had brought together a heap of brushwood, and laid it on the fire, a viper came out, by reason of the heat, and fastened itself on his hand.
\v 4 And when the barbarians saw the reptile hanging from his hand, they said to one another: This man is certainly a murderer, whom, although he has saved himself from the sea, justice does not permit to live.
\v 5 Then he shook the reptile from him into the fire, and suffered no harm.
\v 6 But they were expecting that he would become inflamed and swollen, or would suddenly fall down dead; yet, after expecting it for a long time, and seeing no harm befall him, they changed their mind, and said he was a god.
\p
\v 7 Among the estates about that place were those of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius, who took us to his house, and, for three days, entertained us kindly.
\v 8 And it happened that the father of Publius was lying sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul went in to him, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and restored him to health.
\v 9 Therefore, after this had been clone, the rest also in the island who had diseases, came and were cured.
\v 10 And they also honored us with many honors; and, when we put to sea, they supplied us with such things as we needed.
\p
\v 11 After three months we put to sea in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the island, whose sign was the Dioscuri.
\v 12 And we landed at Syracuse, and remained there three days:
\v 13 from which place, by coasting about, we came to Rhegium; and one day afterward, the south wind arose; and we came, on the next day, to Puteoli,
\v 14 where we found brethren, and were persuaded to remain with them seven days. And thus we went toward Home.
\v 15 And from this place, the brethren, having heard of us, came out as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns, to meet us. When Paul saw the brethren, he thanked God, and took courage.
\p
\v 16 When we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself, with a soldier that guarded him.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass, after three days, that he called together the chief men of the Jews; and when they had come, he said to them: Brethren, though I have done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
\v 18 They, after examination, would have released me, for they found no cause of death in me.
\v 19 But because the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Cæsar: not that I have any accusation to bring against my own nation.
\v 20 For this reason, I called for you, that I might see you and speak to you; for on account of the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.
\p
\v 21 And they said to him: We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor has any one of the brethren come, and reported or spoken any evil of you.
\v 22 But we think it right to hear from you what you think: for, as it respects this sect, we know that it is everywhere spoken against.
\p
\v 23 And when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom, from morning till evening;, he earnestly testified, and set forth the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and from the prophets.
\v 24 And some believed the things that were spoken, and some believed not.
\v 25 And not agreeing among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken one word: Well did the Holy Spirit speak to our fathers by Isaiah the prophet,
\v 26 saying: Go to this people and say, You shall surely hear, but you will not understand; and you shall surely see, but you will not perceive.
\v 27 For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should turn, and I should restore them to health.
\v 28 Therefore, be it known to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.
\v 29 And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, and had great disputation among themselves.
\v 30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all that came to him,
\v 31 preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all boldness and without hinderance.
